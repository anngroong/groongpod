Topics:

-- 00:00:00 Introduction

-- 00:03:31 Azerbaijani Aggression: As many expected, Azerbaijan commenced a violent war against Armenia on September 13. There are hundreds of casualties including civilians and Armenian territories that have fallen in the hands of the aggressor. A fragile cease-fire is in place for now. We’ll analyze with our guests the basic facts and try to make sense of what happened.

-- 00:11:04 Russia and CSTO: The troubling aggression by Azerbaijan brought more troubles to Armenia’s relationship with Russia and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) which so far is not sending any military aid but will only send a fact-finding mission to Armenia. Do Armenians (including our leadership) have unrealistic expectations from the organization? Listen to us to find out.

- 00:41:24 UN & International Reaction: Next, we’ll analyze international reaction to the attack including Armenia’s appeal to the UN Security Council as well as interests of Armenia’s Southern neighbor Iran.

- 00:54:35 War Communications (Karen Vrtanesyan): How did the Armenian government communicate with the public. Is the Armenian government trying to conceal the scale and impact of the Azerbaijani attack? 

- 01:07:13 Nancy Pelosi (Suren Sargsyan): A high profile congressional delegation visited Armenia this week, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We’ll get analysis from our experts on what this means for US-Armenia relations.

Conversation with Dr. Vahram Ter-Matevosyan

Armenian News Network/Groong - September 12, 2022

Recently two AUA professors (Prof. Hovhannes Nikoghosyan and  Prof. Vahram Ter-Matevosyan) published a paper in Taylor and Francis Online (TANDF) that analyzes the foreign policy decision making (FPDM) process of the Nikol Pashinyan administration, titled: ""From ‘revolution’ to war: deciphering Armenia’s populist foreign policy-making process"". In this episode, we talk to one of the authors of the paper, Prof. Ter-Matevosyan.

TOPICS:

* Opening (00:00:00)
* Introduction (00:02:22) - We discuss how the idea for the paper arose and the process through which the two scholars went through to conduct their research. 

* TURKEY (00:22:51) - One specific aspect of the war, that played a significant role in the outcome, was Turkey’s involvement. In our opinion, just by sharing with Azerbaijan accurate NATO signals and satellite intelligence in the form of targets to destroy is more than enough to consider its role as decisive. Turkey went beyond that of course. Thus, paying attention and estimating Turkey’s willingness to intervene on behalf of Azerbaijan would be critical for Armenia’s leadership. We of course have seen different members of the Pashinyan team assure the press and public, even weeks before the war, that Turkey would not dare intervene.

    - Have you looked at this aspect of Armenia’s foreign policy?
    - What did Pashinyan’s team do (or perhaps didn’t do) in this area to accurately assess the risk of intervention from Turkey and to put mitigations to counter this risk?
    - Was there any specific contact with Turkey in the run-up to Sep 2020?
    - How critical were Pashinyan’s and Armen Sarkissian’s statements on the 100th anniversary of Treaty of Sevres?

* RUSSIA ( 00:37:18) - Many, especially those in the pro-Pashinyan camp today, blame Russia for throwing Armenia under the bus for better relations with Turkey. 

    - What was the conduct of Pashinyan’s foreign policy with Russia like, preceding and during the war?
    - Are the claims that Russia deceived its ally Armenia correct?
    - Did Russia in recent years ever send a signal to Armenia that it would help defend Artsakh? 

* AZERBAIJAN (00:46:56) - Many of the analysts we talk to state that it was pretty much obvious that Aliyev was gearing up for war starting from 2011 when he effectively rejected the peace deal being considered at the time. It is apparent that Azerbaijan also bid its time, preparing militarily but also tactically selecting a suitable period in time. In 2020, the world was preoccupied with Covid and in the US it was election season, as well as a period of near isolationism from foreign involvements in the Trump administration.

    - Despite the external factors, was there anything that Armenia did bilaterally with Azerbaijan that could have delayed the war or helped change its outcome?
    - What was the outcome of the infamous Dushanbe elevator meeting?

Conversation with Anna Abrahamian

In the spring and summer of 2022 the Armenian parliamentary opposition was in the streets of Yerevan in large numbers, with a goal to remove the de-facto prime minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan. That failed, or at least did not achieve all of the goals it had set for itself.

Especially as we near the end of August and the protests are set to restart, we’re analyzing what didn’t work, and how to take more effective steps forward. We want to look at specific issues such as whether to move for impeachment or not.

To talk about this issue, today we have Anna Abrahamian, who is a geopolitical analyst currently splitting her time between Moscow and Athens.

On August 23, 1990 the Supreme Council of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic proclaimed Armenia as independent. 

True, Armenia officially celebrates independence day on September 21, due to the referendum which was held on Sep 21 1991, the following year. But for me, the date of August 23 - the date of the proclamation of the declaration of independence - is no less special. 

For it is this document comprised of 12 articles that form the basis for all laws in Armenia and for the constitution itself. From the need to establish historic justice, especially referencing the Armenian Genocide, the reunification of Armenia and Artsakh, the recognition of the rights of citizenship for Diasporans, to me these principles encapsulate perfectly the aspirations of the Armenian people at that time and even more so today.

After a millennium without a state (with the exception of the three years of the first republic between 1918 and 1921) the foundation for a new state was established.

This document and the principles enshrined in it are to be cherished and protected! And regardless of their individual flaws or your political judgement, the men and women of the Supreme Council are true statesmen and the founding parents of Armenia.

Just think about it! Out of a global family of 1000s of nations and tribes, only a few were lucky enough or had the right circumstances in order to establish their own state and become a political nation. And Armenians were one of them.

- 00:00:00 Introduction

- 00:02:25 Opposition Protests in Yerevan: Thousands showed up to the opposition protest on Tuesday, outlining the red lines for Pashinyan's dealings with Aliyev, ahead of the meeting in Brussels. Opposition says this is only the beginning, but have yet to indicate what their next steps will be.

- 00:12:35 Buying Bread from a Man in Brussels: Pashinyan went to Brussels this week to meet with Charles Michel and Ilham Aliyev. Did the Armenian PM firmly set his foot down and demand Azerbaijan withdraw from Karaglukh? Will our POWs come back soon? Or did Pashinyan just eat his Azeri vegemite sandwich and come back home?

- 00:34:45 Working for the man: The last time one of our guests Alison was on the show, she was hoping to help advise the Armenian government. We'll hear about her experiences since we last spoke, and what kind of room Armenia has to maneuver in this complicated geopolitical situation.

- 00:48:02 War and the Armenian Economic Outlook: With our analyst, we'll look at some economic problems stemming from the larger war in the region.

- 00:59:09 New MPG polls on Ukraine, Artsakh: The results of the newest MPG poll are out, with questions on Armenian sentiments about the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical issues. Are Armenians truly keen on opening the border with Turkey, with or without Turkish preconditions. Stay tuned to hear more.

- 01:24:58 Alison in Artsakh: And lastly today, we'll talk about the situation in Artsakh with Alison, who just returned from a weekend trip. She will share with us her impressions of her first time back since the war.

Description:

In this Conversations on Groong episode, we'll be talking with two specialists from Armenia and from Azerbaijan, and explore their views and perspectives on the problems and solutions they envision for long-term peace between the neighbors.

Since the second war in Artsakh in 2020, also known as the 44-Day war, which culminated in the signing of the November Agreement by Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia, the three countries have been negotiating the fulfillment of that agreement. The agreement contained 9 points, of which the first 5 are primarily complete, 6 and 7 are more or less in progress, but 8 and 9 continue to be deeply problematic despite intensive and contentious yearlong negotiations.

What are the perspectives and stumbling blocks that have prevented peace, a year after the war ended?

Why is there a need to have such a discussion right now? The temperature of the post-war negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan has reached a boiling point, with Azerbaijan's president Aliyev issuing ultimatums and demands for dates for Armenia to open ""corridors"" for Azerbaijan. In trying to create a more informed Armenian public about these negotiations, we hope that such discussions can clarify what the sides are saying to each other, and what the sides are hearing from each other.

A conversation with Areg Danagoulian and Emil Sanamyan

Recording of A live Clubhouse conversation on June 14, 2021

As part of the November 9th Agreement, Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to a number of points, one of which was the unblocking of all transportation routes in the region and opening unfettered access between Azerbaijan and Nakhijevan. The specific wording of Article 9 goes as follows:

All economic and transport connections in the region shall be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia shall guarantee the security of transport connections between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to arrange unobstructed movement of persons, vehicles and cargo in both directions. The Border Guard Service of the Russian Federal Security Service shall be responsible for overseeing the transport connections.”

Note that the agreement does not provide for a physical corridor, but rather unfettered access to be overseen by “FSB.”  This point in the agreement has led to much contention and consternation. While Azerbaijan and Turkey have been talking about reopening of borders, Armenia has refused so far to provide the said transportation link.

A Conversation with Dr. Simon Saradzhyan, Arthur G. Martirosyan, and Tevan Poghosyan

The disastrous outcome of the 2020 War in Artsakh has left Armenians in Armenia and around the world with many unanswered questions. Many long-time held beliefs about the capability of Armenia to defend Artsakh, and Armenia itself, were shattered on November 9, with the signing of the trilateral ceasefire statement.

A group of more than 10 academics and researchers recently published a lengthy set of questions that are proposed as a basis for a fact-finding commission to investigate the causes and results of the war. The document can be found on the web at https://armeniacommission.org

A Conversation with Robert Markarian

The South Caucasus comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. The three regional powers surrounding them are Russia to the north, Turkey to the west, and Iran in the south.

Iran has been largely quiet about events on its northern border with Armenia and Azerbaijan, due largely to its marginalization on the world stage because of the Western economic sanctions but also because Iran is home to millions of ethnic Azeris and any perceived support for Armenia could result in additional political instability at home.

Yet, Iran is hugely influential, and Armenian-Iranian relations have been largely positive in modern times, especially in the post-Soviet era. So how should we view our relations with Iran today, and especially in the past year? And what should we expect in the future?

Guest:

Robert Markarian, who has degrees in physics and law from Tehran University, and has published several political articles about Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh in Armenian and Persian newspapers and political journals such as Alik, Iranian Diplomacy, IRAS (The Institute for Iran-Eurasia Studies), IPSC (International Peace Studies Center) and The California Courier.  His articles in Armenian, Farsi and English are available on robertmarkarian.com. He studies and has presented on the position of the Iranian Government and scientific-research centers on the conflict around Nagorno Karabakh at conferences such as the Pan-Armenian Conference of Political Scientists and International Relations Experts (November, 2012) and more.

All modern wars are accompanied by cyber-activities. Can we talk about what this looked like during the 44-day war?

Some major potential security incidents during the war: 

- Gov.am and Primeminister.am defacement
- MFA compromise (or maybe it's part of a larger thing)
- Metsamor NPP compromise

Out of tens of incidents registered by security experts, only a few were publicly acknowledged by the Armenian government and the results of such incidents were not published. Incidents varied and included defacement, denial of service attacks, leaks of personal information, as well as leaks of potentially sensitive data apparently from government agencies such as the foreign ministry and national security service.

What was the potential for offensive cyber-security operations by Azerbaijan to be leveraged to achieve results directly on the battlefield? How about radio-electronic warfare itself?
Is the lack of public response due to secrecy or is there a deeper issue such as being able to analyze incidents fully and understand their full impact?

Lessons Learned

Given Armenia’s need to restore military readiness especially in the areas of cyber-security, what are some key lessons for the Armenian side?

- Institutionalized CERT that is independent from government.
- Cyber-security divisions in all government institutions.
- Acceptance and implementation of widely accepted NIST standards
- Prioritize the most easy-to-implement steps first.

The aim of those diplomatic initiatives was to find a solution to the conflict by engaging in direct diplomatic negotiations as well as track two diplomacy.

In September 2020, diplomatic initiatives gave way to a military one resulting in a war that reversed Armenia’s military successes and led to the signing of a cease-fire agreement which completely undermined Armenia’s position vis-a-vis Azerbaijan and Turkey.

To understand the background of Armenia’s diplomatic activities before the war as well as to look at the future of Armenia’s role in the region, today we will discuss the challenges and opportunities faced by Armenia in the last two decades as well as the way forward. 

Today we’re joined by:

Conversations on Groong

Academia and academic work, especially in the fields of humanities and social sciences, has always been instrumentalized by various ideologies and/or political regimes. Moreover, various disciplines within each of those fields such as anthropology, art history, literature, etc., have a long tradition of being the middle children of academia and are rarely considered to have a role in shaping minds and trends in society. In Armenia the roles of humanities and social science have undergone changes since soviet and immediate post-soviet times. At a time where both these fields were viewed as instruments of legitimization of Communism and later nationalism, academics in these fields had to navigate the murky waters of ideology less they were willing to be labeled “pseudo-academics” or even worse as traitors.

The challenge of having robust disciplines in humanities and social sciences in Armenia is manifold. These include encouraging critical thinking void of ideology, the role of individuals with degrees in humanities and social sciences in the larger society, challenging pre-existing paradigms and many more.

What are Russia’s interests in the region, and in this agreement?

His analyses on Russia, Armenia, and the post-Soviet space have appeared in several publications, including The Nation, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Russian International Affairs Council, Russia Direct, Hetq, and more.


-- Why is the South Caucasus so important to Russia? Are Russia’s interests the same as they were 200 years ago, as an expanding power in the region?
-- Why is Karabakh important enough for Moscow to commit its troops?
-- How does the Kremlin perceive the current leaderships in Yerevan and Baku?
-- How many towers to the Kremlin? What are the different factions within the Russian ruling elite? How do perceptions of the region and solutions for it differ among them?
-- How is Turkey viewed within the context of Russian regional strategy?
-- Finally, let’s talk about the November statement and beyond! What does Russian intervention mean? Where does Moscow go from here?

Soviet or Armenian? The Life and Times of Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan


Born in Sanahin, Armenia in 1895, Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan was the most prominent Soviet state figure of Armenian origin. A survivor, Mikoyan managed to weather every Soviet leader from Lenin to Brezhnev.  He was once the #2 man in Moscow after Nikita Khrushchev, and his legacy is complex.  Today on Groong, we will explore this extraordinary historical figure.

To help us unpack the historical legacy of Mikoyan, 𝐏𝐢𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐨 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐤𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐧 joins us today from Cleveland. Pietro is a historian and a Ph.D. candidate in Russian History at the Ohio State University. His dissertation focuses on Mikoyan’s reforms in de-Stalinization and the nationality sphere in the Khrushchev-era USSR. His analyses on Russia, Armenia, and the post-Soviet space have appeared in The Nation, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the Russian International Affairs Council, Russia Direct, and Hetq.  He has also worked with the Gomidas Institute in London on the republication of 19th century accounts of the Russian Caucasus and Armenia.

Artsakh in the Arab Media - Oct 28, 2020

Since September 27, Azerbaijan has been waging an all out war on Artsakh, cluster-bombing towns and villages and killing civilians and destroying churches and cultural centers, with the aim to destroy and depopulate the region. The worldwide Armenian Diaspora has come together to fight this existential threat.

We’ve read much about the Diaspora’s activities around most of the world, but what about the Arab world? This episode explores some of the challenges and opportunities that the Armenian communities in the Arab world face.

To help guide today’s Conversation on Groong, we have with us Prof. 𝐀𝐬𝐛𝐞𝐝 𝐊𝐨𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐤𝐢𝐚𝐧, who is a senior lecturer of political science and international relations at Bentley University in Massachusetts where he teaches courses on the Middle East and the former Soviet space.

Prof. Kotchikian is joined by:

She has published two books which compile newspaper articles and reports from the Genocide years published in the Canadian and British press. Katia has been compiling news for the Armenian News Network Groong since 1999.

And

This episode of the podcast was fully devoted to the war in Artsakh. It was recorded on the morning of Saturday, Oct 3 Pacific time while one of our guests, Varuzhan Geghamyan was in Stepanakert as the city was undergoing constant bombardment.

Unfortunately, the air assault on Stepanakert and other civilian areas of Artsakh seems to have only intensified with more active use of cluster bombs, long-range missiles and suicide drones. As of early Monday morning (Pacific time) we have confirmed that Varuzhan is OK though he communicated that the situation is dangerous as the city is still under constant bombardment.

The use of cluster munitions, let alone targeting of civilian structures, is prohibited by international law and it seems that the dictator in Baku, Ilham Aliyev, is intent to level the city to the ground. As of this time, according to the Artsakh foreign ministry, 19 civilians have been killed, 80 wounded, and over 2700 property and civilian infrastructure has been damaged. We’re worried about the safety of Artsakh’s peaceful civilian population and urge you to raise awareness of this travesty among your non-Armenian friends and elected representatives.

Conversations on Groong

It’s been two and a half years since the dramatic popular protests of 2018 that resulted in the resignation of Serge Sargsyan and the subsequent election of Nikol Pashinyan as Prime Minister in Armenia. The change in power, which is commonly referred to as “The Velvet Revolution”, gave many the hope of a more democratic Armenia. Many promises were made in 2018, and mid-way through this administration many of us want to know how the Armenian government is delivering on those promises.
In this Conversation On Groong, we talk to two long-time activists who ended up on opposite sides of the fence on this topic with one becoming a member of parliament while the other a fiery critic of the government. 

𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐲𝐚𝐧 is the president of the Civic Forum NGO. She holds a Masters degree in Educational Management from Yerevan State University.

Conversations on Groong

Background and formulation of the telecoms market in Armenia

Telecommunications market in Armenia started with the monopoly of the incumbent operator ArmenTel owned jointly by Greek state owned company OTE (90%) and Armenian government (10%). The sale-purchase agreement granted ArmenTel (recently rebranded to VEON) exclusive rights to provide basic telecommunications services including international Internet connectivity, mobile and fixed telephony. ArmenTel’s monopoly remained till 2005 when after a series of negotiations the monopoly on mobile  communication was abolished and the second operator entered the market. 

In 2007 OTE sold its shares to Vimpelcom, a Russian private company operated under Beeline trademark. Shortly after that Armenian government agreed to sell Vimplecom remained 10% of state owned shares in exchange of liberalization of all telecommunication markets. 2008 can be named as a beginning of Armenian liberal telecommunications market. 

Today, Armenia has three major mobile service providers: two (VEON-Armenia and MTS-Armenia) owned by Russian businesses and one (Ucom) owned by a mixed capital of Armenian and Russian rich families. There are also three leading wireline operators: also two Russina (VEON-Armenia and GNC Alpha also known as Rostelecom) and Ucom. 

One of the most recent development on Armenian telecom market has been Ucom’s intention to purchase VEON that failed due to criminal charged have been brought against one of its owners, Gurgen Khachatryan, the son of former head of state revenue service authority Gagik Khachatryan, who has been arrested and charged of misuse of state budget and money laundering. The story did not stop on this, but it is out of the today main discussion topic today.  

Azerbaijan’s stake in Georgia’s Caucasus Online

Over the past few months, we’ve seen a public tussle between Georgian regulatory firms and a Azeri company called NEQSOL which acquired 49% of Caucasus Online, a Georgian telecommunications company. How does this deal affect Armenian national security given that a significant portion of Armenian internet traffic goes through Georgia (including Caucasus Online)?


National Security Issues related to telecommunications

External nation-state threats:
- Interception
- Traffic analysis
- Denial of service

In general the fact of purchasing or controlling shares by the Azerbaijani company does not result in substantial threats for Armenia in terms of  information  security. The company would remain Georgian, be under the control of Georgian government and unless major shareholders would take a risk of illegal spying on Armenian data traffic it would affect the security of international communication of Armenian citizens and government. However, it doesn’t mean that situation will remain to be comfortable for Armenia: risks of interception of both voice and data traffic will be increased unless Armenian authorities take appropriate security measures. But, the news is a good trigger to think how Armenia may secure its connectivity with the world and what should be done to improve resilience of the country’s communications system. 

What can be done to beef up quality of Armenia’s external communications access?

One of the solutions might be Armenian companies investments in trans-Georgian fiber-optic cable.  Georgia has relatively (compared with other countries of the region) liberal telecommunications legislation including enforceable infrastructure sharing regulation. The first step Armenian government must do is to encourage investments in building such a cable system that both Armenian operators and Georgian businesses may benefit from.

Armenia has European grade laws in the areas of finance, business, data protection and privacy. What is preventing Armenia from achieving its full potential in foreign direct investment (FDI)?  Why do many Armenian startups incorporate in foreign countries, and use Armenia as their offshore labor resource?


Our Guest is
David Sandukhchyan is a lawyer with 20 years of experience in telecommunications, cyber law, media and personal data protection. He started his legal career as an Internet freedom advocate and made substantial contributions to the development of media, telecommunication and technology legislation in Armenia.  David was Chief Counsel for over 8 years at Beeline, one of the leading Armenian telecom operators. From 2005 to 2007 he was a member of the Council of Europe expert group on human rights in information society and committee of experts on electronic democracy.  

Today David lives in Toronto, Canada and as a private consultant he is involved in many Internet freedom, data protection and telecommunications development projects.  He holds a BA degree in law and a Master’s in physics. He is a certified ISO information security auditor with a Certificate in Advanced Cyber Security from York University in Toronto.

Analysis and Discussion
- What were some of the major headaches of the chief counsel for one of the largest telecom operators in Armenia?
- How did the government’s relationship with large companies evolve over your nearly a decade at Armentel?
- Are there citizen initiatives like the EFF to champion privacy protections in Armenia?

Armenia prides itself as the “Silicon Valley of the former USSR” and we have seen some successes where a number of Armenian startups eventually got a significant amount of VC investment in Armenia. Some of the major success stories pride themselves in having a value that’s measured in the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. For instance, the best-known startup PicsArt has received $65 million VC investment so far according to Crunchbase. Another popular startup Krisp is in the Series A funding stage with $8.5 million so far, and there are more examples.

But there is a common pattern we’re seeing. In both cases, we’ve seen these startups re-incorporate in the US (specifically Silicon Valley) prior to getting investments. What this means in reality is that these companies become US companies and the value of the company largely transfers from Armenia to the US, leaving the Armenian branch as an outsourcing center for the US company. 

Armenia is compliant with EU regulations, so the laws are pretty good. But the way Armenina works is not great because it works on the basis that people should trust the government. But the basis for this trust is not in place. What are the causes for this? 

- Lack of trust by foreign investors because their capital is not protected;
- Judiciary: personalities & processes;
- Kompromat as part of “the system”;
- Armenian government's stance on the issue of privacy, media freedoms.

Background of education reform(s) in Armenia
In depth analysis of the content, standards & measurable outcomes of the proposed curriculum’s history & literature segments.
Challenges of implementing the proposed curriculum 

In recent months, Armenia’s government has published its proposal for K-12 curriculum reform in Armenian schools. The new curriculum, which includes education standards and learning outcomes, proved to be quite controversial with many individuals and groups criticizing one aspect or another of the proposed curriculum notably the segments on literature and Armenian history. These criticisms ranged from in-depth critique of the content of the proposed plan to outlandish and sometimes baseless accusations. In order to shed some light on this issue specifically the history and literature components of the new proposed curriculum, this week we have invited two scholars who have been following these debates and the content of the new curriculum intimately. 

Asbed Kotchikian is a senior lecturer of political science and international relations at Bentley University in Massachusetts where he teaches courses on the Middle East and former Soviet space. Prof. Kotchikian is also a consultant for international organizations on issues of judicial reform, ways to combat radicalization and on ethnic and religious minorities. He discusses the  proposed reforms with:

Prof. Ara Sanjian is Associate Professor of History and the Director of the Armenian Research Center at University of Michigan, Dearborn. He received his undergraduate degree from Yerevan State University (YSU) in what was then the Soviet Republic of Armenia, and has been involved in numerous academic projects in Armenia. His research interests focus on the post-World War I history of Armenia, Turkey and the Arab states of Western Asia. And:

Prof. Siranush Dvoyan is a literary studies scholar and associate professor of Armenian and Comparative Literature at the American University of Armenia. She is a graduate of YSU and taught there for over a decade.

Discussion:
- Brief background
- The background of the current proposed curriculum: When was it conceived and what has its development process been like and who were involved in the committee?

- In terms of content, how does the proposed curriculum compare to the previous one? What are some of the main changes, additions, omissions?
-- In literature?
-- In history?
- About the standards and measurements of the proposed curricula: How realistic and feasible are the norms, standards and measurable outcomes as defined by the new curriculum?
- About the implementation (pedagogy) of the proposed curricula: how feasible is it? Is there a trained and knowledgeable workforce of teachers and instructors with mastery of the proposed content, to deliver it with excellence to students?
- Rating of the current AND the proposed curricula.

In 2002, Turkey’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) won a sweeping victory in the country’s general elections, dominating and shaping domestic and foreign policies of Turkey for nearly two decades to this date. Outwardly, under Erdogan’s and AKP’s leadership, Turkey has transformed from a country with a stated and acclaimed foreign policy seeking “zero problems with neighbors” to one that is actively engaged in economic, political and military rivalry with its Middle East and other regional neighbors, as well as balancing global players. Armenia is deeply affected by the quality of relationships that Turkey conducts with each of its neighbors.

In this first part of our Conversation on Groong about Turkey, we explore Continuity and Change in Political Culture and Foreign Policy in Turkey covering transition from Kemalism to Islamism, as defined by the AKP. We look at how recent events fit together within the framework of continuous, yet changing, state policies. We also discuss Turkey’s foreign policy in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean.
