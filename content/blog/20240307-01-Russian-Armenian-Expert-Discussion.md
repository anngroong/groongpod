**Asbed**: Okay. Let's jump into our first topic.

Arthur, last week we were talking with Dr. Sergei Melkonian about
the Russian-Armenian experts dialogue that was held in Yerevan on
February 24. So this is where the Russian and Armenian experts
discussed the state of relations between the two countries.

You were also there. So we thought we'd ask you the same questions
we asked Dr. Melkonian.

Can you tell us what your overall impressions were of this dialogue?

**Arthur**: Well, I thought it was a very interesting and sincere
exchange of opinions. It made a lot of waves in Armenia. There was
a lot of resonance. A lot of it was very negative because some of
the media channels associated with these authorities reacted very
negatively to the word of truth that came from that meeting.

The Russian side was very open and very clear. In fact, it made me
a little bit uncomfortable saying that, so you guys paid the price
for your Western reorientation, Karabakh was the first part of it,
you already paid that and you're going to pay some more. It was
very clear, kind of in-your-face kind of statement.

**Asbed**: Were they alluding to Syunik by that?

**Arthur**: Well, they were alluding to something, yeah. Could be Syunik,
could be Sevan. Somebody, another expert I met a couple of days ago
said that maybe it wouldn't be Sevan.  They will start with Sevan
and you know that if they reach the lake, they're within I think
10 kilometers. Yeah. If they reach the coast...

**Hovik**: I believe one of the speakers said "Western Azerbaijan".

**Arthur**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Hovik**: So maybe all of Armenia.

**Arthur**: Good, good, good memory. Good memory, Hovik. That's exactly
what he said. You will live in Western Azerbaijan, which means there
will be no more Armenia. The dangers are that they will reach Sevan,
then Sevan will become a joint kind of interstate lake, which means
they will be entitled to half of everything that it has, which means
that if there will be no fish, the ecology will be destroyed, the
lake will be destroyed.

And then of course, much more importantly, they want the southern
corridor and the West supports them. So there are a lot of dangers.

**Hovik**: Essentially, a treaty of Aleksandropol v2.

**Arthur**: Oh yeah, I was talking about it, I think for the last three
years that there's going to be a treaty of Aleksandropol.

What puzzles me is that we have a population in Armenia that somehow
thinks that it doesn't concern it. You know, it doesn't concern
them.  And I think their plan is to emigrate.

Naira Zorabian just mentioned a number a couple of days ago saying
600,000 Armenians filed for a green card lottery, if I participate
in the green card lottery. So 600,000, that's one third of our
population. And there's 140,000 Armenians left in the last few
years. I forget exactly how many years, like three years, maybe.
That's that.

Also I'm very puzzled by what's happening in the diaspora. I mean,
your guys' audience is the diaspora Armenians. I'm wondering, like,
what are they thinking? Is everybody just sitting at home and just
watching this happen in front of their eyes, calmly kind of taking
it in? Apparently there are some people in diaspora who support
this regime.

So the questions are not for the Azeris. They are behaving very
logically. They treat us like a defeated Nazi Germany.

The questions are for our community. What are you guys thinking?
Like, what are you hoping for?  That's the interesting part.

**Hovik**: So, Arthur, going back to the panel discussion that we had,
according to some Russian experts on that panel, Russia is currently
conducting a damage control policy with regard to Armenia. In other
words, a passive policy.

Clearly, I mean, they see their troubles in Ukraine and elsewhere
as strategic and primary. But to us, it's dumbfounding when they
are able to delegate or delay anything they do here until that is
resolved.  At least that's the common narrative of why they are
passive.

At the same time, some of the experts on that same panel also blamed
Armenia for the worsening of relations. We also heard Lavrov's
statement at the Antalya conference, where he basically said that
if the majority of Armenians support Pashinyan, then we will take
more decisive actions, which is in line with these threatening
statements.

So my question is, were you able to detect any introspection by the
Russians? Do any of them accept that their own policies may have
contributed to damaging the Armenian-Russian relationship? Or should
we even worry about it? Because they just think they're an empire
and they get to do whatever they want.

**Arthur**: As to what they think, I think a lot of them admit that
they made some mistakes, and I pointed it out also, saying that
when they didn't condemn the Azeri invasion of Armenia, it was a
mistake and it was used to the maximum by the local anti-Russian
propaganda machine.

So I did point it out to them several times, in fact. Yes, they
made some mistakes, but of course, blaming Russia for everything,
when we have a government that surrenders Karabakh without getting
anything in return and declares that Karabakh is part of our
neighboring state, and then during the war, during the ethnic
cleansing, says that it doesn't concern us, we're not interested,
it's very hard to blame Russia for anything when our own government
has betrayed its people.

And that's what they're saying. Like, do you guys expect us to be
more Armenian than you? That's their standard argument.

I'm not interested in their justifications.  The reality of it is
that we've ruined our relationship with Russia. The Azeris have
not. They have an excellent diplomatic strategy. They have a very
qualified diplomatic corps. They have great relations with Russia,
great relations with the West. Everybody needs them. Everybody wants
them. And we are like the poor relative waiting in the hallway. So
we're back to the 19th century, early 20th century. Nothing changes
with us.

So yeah, the Russians were very aggressive, very straightforward.
You're going to pay some more. And they're prepared to not care if
we go down.  At least that's what they're telling us. We can keep
our part of the Caucasus.  You guys can go down. We'll make a deal
with the Turks, because, you know, you're completely unreliable and
you don't know what you want.

That's what they're telling us.

**Hovik**: So that's what I want to actually tease out. Is it that
Russia will, in spite of what happens or, you know, in an act of
spite, try to actively hurt Armenia geopolitically? Or do they see
it as an expense that they can get rid of protecting Armenia if
Armenia decides to make trouble and it's already essentially like
going against Russian interests and going against the alliance, a
strategic alliance, at least that we have on paper?

**Arthur**: I think they're prepared to do both. I don't think they
will actively intervene and try to salvage anything they have here.
I think they're just going to, you know, show us what the consequences
will be for this kind of behavior.

There are some rumors already that some economic sanctions are in,
you know, in the pipeline.  So there will be some economic sanctions
coming. I think they'll just punish us for it. And then if we still
persist in it, they'll just withdraw. I think they will. They're
not going to fight for us. They're certainly not going to fight
Turkey and Azerbaijan. Turkey is a very important country for them
and for the West. Turkey is part of their strategy of creating a
counterbalance to Western influence.

I mean, I think it's a mistake, but we can't tell them what their
policy should be. They are the ones who decide that. They have a
very strong pro-Turkish lobby. Our behavior has given them all the
grounds for considering us completely unreliable and irrational
state.

So a lot of them are inclined to cooperate with Turkey. And if need
be, I think they will withdraw from here. I don't think Russia is
going to launch any kind of a major intervention here.

**Asbed**: Arthur, Sergei mentioned that Russian analysts generally
agree that Russia's decision to not support the Armenian opposition
in 2021 was a mistake. In fact, you were slightly involved in 2021
with the opposition.

Do you have any thoughts on that point that you can expand on?

**Arthur**: It's hard for me to say. In 2021, I made some attempts to
help the opposition, but I wasn't really in the process of preparing
for elections or creating some kind of strategy or, you know, going
out talking to people.

I wasn't part of it, but I made some attempts. What I hear from a
lot of people here is that, yes, Russia didn't really help the
opposition and in a way, it actually helped this guy because this
guy makes it very convenient for Russia. He constantly gives in.
He makes concession after concession, so Russia doesn't have to
fight for anything. It creates an alibi for Russia to give in.

So that's what I've heard. It's hard for me to say because I don't
like to talk about things that I don't know from my personal
knowledge. But that's the theory I've heard is that they prefer
this guy. At least they preferred him in the past.

**Asbed**: At the time.

**Arthur**: At the time. Yeah.

**Asbed**:  I think it was that Pashinyan was at the time still helping
implement the trilateral agreement, so they were okay with him.

**Hovik**: Yes. Yes. And, you know, I think one of the things that
definitely helped Pashinyan prior to the election was Putin basically
being all warm with Pashinyan. We can see the contrast with today.

He said that Pashinyan is not, I don't believe Pashinyan is a
traitor. We also, you know, people drew a stark contrast between
the involvement of some Russian companies and the Russian community
in the 2018 coup.

**Arthur**: Everybody talks about it.

**Hovik**: You know, huge, huge companies like Gazprom or whatever. I
don't want to name names, but, you know, it seemed like there were
a lot of employees of Russian companies out on the streets as well
marching.

Meanwhile, none of that was happening in 2021. So that's another
data point that the opposition uses to allege that Russia not only
did not do anything against Pashinyan to help the opposition, but
also actually helped Pashinyan in 2021 as well.

**Hovik**: Let's move on now. Just this past week in highly publicized
comments to the Armenian parliament, Pashinyan said that he is ready
to pull out of the CSTO and that the CSTO has become a security
threat for Armenia.

Obviously, this is not the first time Armenia has been taking
potshots at the CSTO and Russian military presence in general. And
to France 24, in an interview two weeks ago, he said that Russia
had fomented unrest in Armenia after the ethnic cleansing of Artsakh
in September, 2023, hoping for regime change in Armenia.

What was the sense of the experts at that discussion about such
comments from Pashinyan?

Athur: Yeah, I admire the strength of your nervous system. I cannot
bear hearing his voice. I cannot bear hearing this guy. But yes,
I've heard it. The style, this group has a certain style of doing
things. They constantly change their story. They change their story.
They come up with new justifications.

Now they're saying Russia did everything wrong since 1991. It's all
Russia's fault. It's very childish. It's childish justifications
they find for themselves.

I don't give any credence to these statements. I don't think Russia
is interested in changing any regimes here. They constantly blame
Russia for wanting Armenia to be part of the union state with Belarus
and Russia. That is not the case. Russian experts and statesmen
have repeatedly said that this is not what we want. We don't want
you as part of the union with Belarus. We don't like, we don't want
that idea.

They keep coming up with these very pathetic justifications. It's
constant informational manipulation. They constantly change their
story. One day, we are the most pro-Russian regime. The other day,
Russia is a threat to our security.  They want to remove the Russian
border guards at the airport. Then they're going to remove them
from the actual border with Turkey and Azerbaijan. And then it's,
of course, they're going to close down the base.

What's interesting is that all of it happened after he met the head
of the British intelligence, Richard Moore. Once he met this guy,
then he came back and all these aggressive anti-Russian steps
followed. It's difficult not to conclude that this was a result of
that meeting.
