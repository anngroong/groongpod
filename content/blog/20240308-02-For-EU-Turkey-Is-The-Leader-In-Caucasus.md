Against the backdrop of Turkey's strategic significance, the debate underscores the profound implications of EU's reliance on Ankara to assert its dominance and open communication channels in the region.

**Hovik**: Arthur, earlier you had said that Russia sees Turkey as a
counterbalance to the West.  But I question how far can that theory
go in case of more acute conflagrations?

Let me read another statement heard in Antalya, and I'm quoting.

"In addition to the involvement of the EU, we're also waiting for
Turkey and its regional leadership to become involved. Ankara can
have a strong influence in opening communication channels in the
region and asserting the role of its dominant power in the region."

That was Toivo Klaar, EU Special Representative for the South
Caucasus.

Your thoughts on that statement?


**Arthur**: My thoughts on this statement are that this is something
that we've been talking about for the last 35 years.  So asking me
now, why is it so, makes me laugh. And I know you know it, and I
know Asbed knows it. We have been saying it for the last 35 years,
that the West is going to hand this region over to Turkey to balance
Russia, force Russia out, and have Turkey manage the region, which
would result in Armenia's annihilation and in declarations from the
West. Just like they said, the ethnic cleansing of Karabakh is not
acceptable. And a few days later, they were shaking Aliyev's hand
and congratulating him on his re-election.

So we have been saying this for a long time. Why did people not
want to understand it? I don't know. But now we hear it loud and
clear. They want Turkey to be the boss, because they want Iran out,
and they want Russia out.

**Asbed**: Do you think that the same fate awaits Georgia by any chance?
Is Georgia in as much trouble as Armenia is?

**Arthur**: If I were Georgia, I would think very carefully about who's
going to come next. Because as the Kurds in the Ottoman Empire found
out, after they ate Armenians for breakfast, they ate them for
lunch. And now they're busy fighting for their own existence in
Turkey.

So if I were Georgian, I would think very carefully about what's
going to happen to them once Armenia disappears and Turkey and
Azerbaijan unite and turn their gaze northward, towards the north.
Because then Georgia is going to be the next little sandwich they're
going to want to chew. And they can. They have like 95 million
people. Georgia has like four, I think. They're also very small.

And then if I were Russia, I would think very carefully about where
Turkey is going to go next with its Ottoman Empire. But we can't
talk to Russians this way. They don't like it. And we shouldn't
explain to them what their interests are.

We should at least try to be reasonable and rational in our own
foreign policy. And this is not a rational foreign policy. This is
a tragic sitcom. This is not a foreign policy. This is a disaster.
One disaster after another with complete complacency from the
diaspora and from the Armenian people.

**Hovik**: So my question is not related to questioning Russia's
motivations with regard to Turkey. But geo-strategically speaking,
obviously Russia also has made some calculations in its relationship
with Turkey.

So is it reasonable for even Russian officials, in your opinion,
to question Turkey's loyalties to the West and NATO? I mean, how
far, how much, if this thing goes, if the, you know, merde hits the
fan, excuse my French, how much can Russia rely on Turkey? Let's
forget about Armenia, you know, just Russia-Turkey relations. How
much can Russia rely on Turkey?

**Arthur**: Of course Russia understands that it's a dangerous game.
Of course they know this. But in this situation, they have no choice.
They're dependent on Turkey. Their existential enemy, sadly, is the
West. And in their war against the West, they need Turkey to help
in some way.

Until recently, Turkey was their main gateway to the outside world.
They were selling their gas and oil through Turkey. And a lot of
their import or re-import, illegal import from Europe and the West
is coming through Turkey. Turkey's trade grew by 100%, by 200% in
one year. They are dependent on Turkey.

So it is understandable that they're making a temporary concession
to Turkey at our expense. It's ugly, but it's understandable. It's
realpolitik.

But eventually, of course, they would rather not give the whole
Caucasus and Central Asia to Turkey. Because Turkey, when it creates
its empire, it usually looks north. And Turkey hasn't given up its
claims on the Crimea, etc., etc.

It's just a forced compromise, I think. And that's what they're
saying. But in any event, we should first start with our own policy
and our own government. Because we don't have one. We have a bunch
of hysterics who have nothing to do with real policy or rational
thinking or calculation. Who have ruined everything they could have
ruined in six years. And they're still blaming the previous regime
for it. The problem is with us. It's not with Russia.

**Asbed**: I think actually more than can Russia trust or rely on Turkey,
Russia can expect a reliable response from Turkey. They're expected
to look out for their interests and they are absolutely looking out
for their interests. So in a sense, they are a rational actor on
the geopolitical stage. So Russia can rely on that. They know how
the other side is going to respond.

**Arthur**: Yes.

**Asbed**: Unlike Armenia.

**Arthur**: Yes. Turkey is predictable. It's logical. Yes, sometimes
it cheats.  Sometimes it doesn't fulfill its obligations. Like I
said during the conference and then this ridiculous government
picked up on it. They didn't even understand that I was making a
point to the Russians. You were cheated. That Turkey deceived you.
That's what I was trying to convey. And, of course, this government.
I wonder if they graduated from fifth grade. They didn't even
understand my sarcasm. It's unbelievable who is running our country.

Because I told Russians, yeah, you're playing your game with Turkey.
We understand. But they cheated on you, didn't they? Because Finland
and Sweden were allowed to join NATO. They cheated on you.

I mean look how smart Turks are and how manipulative. They got their
F-16s from America even though that was temporarily on hold. They
got their concessions from Russia at our expense and then Finland
and Sweden still became part of NATO. They still allow some NATO
military ships into the Black Sea. It's like they have everybody.

They play everybody. They're playing everybody. The West and Russia.
And they get everything they want.
