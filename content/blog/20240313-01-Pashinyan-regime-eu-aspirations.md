**Hovik**: Mirzoyan said a few other things that I think are interesting
that underline the U-turn in Armenia's foreign policy. He said that
Armenia is significantly deepening its relations with the EU and
potential membership in the EU is also being discussed. I believe
this has been the most clear statement from Armenian foreign policy
officials to date, indicating that Armenia is actually seriously
considering requesting EU membership, even though we got many
different hints in the past.

And this is all in the backdrop of other moves Armenia has made,
such as freezing its activity in the CSTO, threatening to leave the
CSTO and also inviting the Russians out of the Zvartnots airport,
where they have customs control duties under an agreement, bilateral
agreement.

In the past, Pashinyan has said that Armenia would develop its
relations as closely with the EU as the latter deems possible. And
there were also unconfirmed reports this week in Armenian media
that Pashinyan has met with the civil contract team and informed
them that they will need to submit an application to join the EU
by the end of the year. So that's very interesting. We'll see how
that develops. So things are moving fast. And my question to you,
Dziunik, is how do we decipher all of this? How likely do you think
is actually Armenia's potential request to officially join the EU
this year?

**Dziunik**: Well, as I explained the whole situation, the plan was to
bring the South Caucasus total, the whole South Caucasus under the
Western umbrella. And part of the whole process is EU, because you
cannot jump being a member of the CSTO, you cannot immediately jump
into a NATO membership. So this EU membership is an intermediate
step that has to be fulfilled. And, you know, I don't know.

But my belief is that this whole talk will become useless in several
months. I depict the EU as the sinking Titanic, and I don't know
why our government is actually trying to run and jump onto the board
of this sinking vessel when I don't think it will even survive the
post-Ukrainian stage. So whatever is being done will take time.

And I think the geopolitical developments are speeding up to the
actually rocketing to unbelievable stage.  And I think the whole
realpolitik will change the situation and the picture, which we
cannot understand right now, because the social upheavals in Europe
will change the picture.

The elections that are going on throughout the whole major player
countries will change the political picture in those countries and
change the positioning of those countries.

I don't think that by the end of this year, we will have the same
talk because the situation will be different.  But the question is,
where will Armenia be and how complete it will be? Will it survive
this whole situation? And if we manage to get rid of this government
or this political party sitting on top of us, actually cutting the
branch that we are sitting on as a country and as people, if we
manage to get rid of them, then we will survive.  If we don't, I
don't know what status we will be in.
