**Hovik**: Arthur, in the context of the West versus Russia impasse,
French-Armenian relations were in the news last week. We talked at
length about it. But given that we have Arthur, Arthur, you recently
interviewed the deputy editor of Le Figaro, a French newspaper, who
is very influential and has the company and has the ear of Macron
and other French leadership. It was a very interesting interview.
We'll link to it from our podcast.

But I wanted to just sort of ask you what your impressions are.
What is the takeaway from that interview? What did you hear the
deputy editor of Le Figaro said that our listeners should hear?

**Arthur**: In short, he is one of the greatest friends of our people
in France. He loves us. He is much more patriotic than most of the
Armenian population. So he said, we love you guys. You know, I'm
your friend. I was talking to Macron about helping you, doing
anything we can.

But the French people are not going to die for Armenia. We cannot
justify it to our society.  We cannot explain to them why French
guys are going to go and die for Armenia, nor can we risk a war
with Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Russia. That's not going to happen.

And then I questioned him on this delivery of these ridiculous armed
personnel carriers made of glass. And he agreed with me that these
are transport vehicles that France no longer uses. Ukraine turned
them down, and they're mostly exported to African countries and
used for reconnaissance missions.  So it's a complete PR campaign.
We all love France. Nobody loves France more than I do. But they're
turning this into another PR campaign-fairy tale, again in order
to manipulate public opinion.
