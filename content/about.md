Welcome to Groong Podcast, the newest addition to the vibrant Armenian News Network - Groong, a fully volunteer-driven effort dedicated to disseminating Armenian news and fostering dialogue. Originating as a modest mailing list during the early days of the internet, Groong quickly evolved into a vital source of information, particularly during critical periods like the war for Artsakh. Our readership spans the globe, encompassing diverse individuals, Armenian organizations, media professionals, governmental bodies, NGOs, and more. Check out our news site here: [www.groong.org](https://www.groong.org).

While our roots remain in the venerable mailing list format, Groong has adapted to the digital age, embracing social media platforms like Facebook to reach wider audiences. In July 2020, recognizing the need for English-language content, we launched the Groong Podcast. Featuring dynamic formats such as the "Week in Review" and "Conversations on Groong," our podcast offers in-depth analyses, interviews with prominent figures, and discussions on diverse topics including politics, diaspora issues, arts, and culture. Join our Facebook group here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/222784200584.

At Groong, we understand the challenges of navigating the vast landscape of Armenian news. Our mission is to curate reliable information and present it in a balanced, insightful manner, providing listeners with a trusted source for understanding developments in Armenia. Whether you're commuting, multitasking, or simply seeking informed perspectives, join us on this journey of exploration and engagement.
