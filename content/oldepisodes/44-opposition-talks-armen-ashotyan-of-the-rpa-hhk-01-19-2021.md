Following the trilateral Karabakh ceasefire of Nov 9, all major political forces in Armenia (be that parliamentary or extra-parliamentary, except for the ruling party) condemned Nikol Pashinyan’s agreement to the deal.

The Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) has been in control of successive governments (sometimes through coalitions) for over two and a half decades. The party lost its prominence in the December 2018 elections but remained a vocal extra-parliamentary opposition.

Today we’re joined by:

𝐀𝐫𝐦𝐞𝐧 𝐀𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐭𝐲𝐚𝐧, who is the vice president of the Republican Party of Armenia. From 2005 to 2007, Mr. Ashotyan was a member of the National Assembly, and chaired the Committee on Foreign Relations. From 2009 to 2017, Ashotyan served as Minister of Education and Science. In 2017, Ashotyan was elected to the parliament again and served there until the Dec 2018 snap parliamentary elections.

Topics:
- What took place in 2018?
- Why did RPA support Vazgen Manukyan as PM candidate?
- Nov. 9/10 ceasefire agreement & Jan 11 statement
- Is the RPA truly serious about removing Pashinyan? Why hasn’t the opposition mobilized more people onto the streets?
- Lessons learned from Dec. 2018 elections.

Your Hosts:
- 𝐇𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐤 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐲𝐚𝐧
- 𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐧 𝐙𝐚𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐲𝐚𝐧
- 𝐀𝐬𝐛𝐞𝐝 𝐁𝐞𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐚𝐧
