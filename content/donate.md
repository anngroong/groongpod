Support the Groong Podcast and help us amplify our impact! While Asbed and Hovik dedicate their time and expertise to crafting insightful content, our podcast's visibility often falls short in comparison to others. Your donations enable us to streamline manual tasks, invest in essential tools like Canva for top-notch graphics, and leverage AI generators for relevant image assets. With your support, we can enhance our SEO, boost social media promotion, and expand into video content creation, enriching the podcast experience for our audience.

You can contribute to Groong in three main ways:

### Patreon (Preferred)

### Buy Me A Coffee
