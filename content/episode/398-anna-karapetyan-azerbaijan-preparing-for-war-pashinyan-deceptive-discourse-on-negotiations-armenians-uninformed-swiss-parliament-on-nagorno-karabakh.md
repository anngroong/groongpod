In this *Week in Review* episode, we discuss with Dr. Anna Karapetyan Azerbaijan’s increasing military activity and its implications for Armenia’s security, including arms shipments and UAV operations. We also explore Switzerland’s motion advocating for a peace forum to ensure the safe return of displaced Artsakh Armenians and its significance in addressing ethnic cleansing on an international stage.


## Topics Covered:

1. **Azerbaijan’s War Preparations**
    * Evidence of increased military activity, including arms shipments and Turkish UAV operations near Armenia.
    * Pashinyan’s rhetoric regarding "Western Azerbaijan" and its implications.
2. **Swiss Motion on Artsakh Armenians’ Right of Return**
    * Details of Switzerland’s call for an international peace forum to address the safe return of displaced Artsakh Armenians.
    * The significance of the motion in addressing ethnic cleansing and its alignment with international decisions.


## Key Questions Discussed:

* What is the current level of danger Armenia faces given Azerbaijan’s military actions?
* Is the Armenian public desensitized to these threats?
* What are the chances of Azerbaijan’s engagement in Switzerland’s proposed peace initiative?
* How significant is this motion internationally?
