## November 10, Two Years Later from Stepanakert

We’re here to learn how it feels to be in Artsakh, two years after the November 2020 trilateral statement.

* How are Artsakh citizens processing what has transpired over the last two years since the trilateral statement of Nov 9/10?
* Have refugees for the most part returned to their homes, where possible? Are refugees from Hadrut for instance in Stepanakert or in Armenia?
* How has Artsakh’s economy evolved since the end of the war? How are people earning their income?

Two weeks ago the Renaissance Square in Stepanakert was full with a sea of people, over a third of the population of all of Artsakh, who once again told the world that they’re not going to be subjects of geopolitical barters, that their rights of self-determination and to be part of the Armenian nation, to live on their historic land, are inalienable.

* Who was the addressee of that statement? Who do you think they were talking to?
* Besides governments in Yerevan, Baku, Moscow, Washington DC, do you think it was also a call to the Armenian nation?


The entire Artsakh conflict began with protests in the late 80s, where it seems like the entire population of Armenia was out in the streets. It was still the Soviet Union, but the institute of Samizdat was well-established at that point. I remember as not even a teenager going to visit our neighbor’s home to read the latest news or articles about Artsakh, often self-published and handed down from one person to another.

* The turnout of the Yerevan version of that protest was pretty low in comparison. Of course, the situation in 1988 is not directly comparable to now, but what do you think needs to be done better to instill confidence in Artsakhtsis that the entire Armenian nation is behind them?
