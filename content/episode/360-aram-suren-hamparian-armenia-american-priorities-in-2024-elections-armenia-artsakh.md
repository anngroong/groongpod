# Armenian American Priorities in the 2024 US Elections

The Democratic and Republican national conventions have come and gone with great pomp and circumstance, and we now know the major candidates vying for the presidency of the United States: Donald Trump & JD Vance on the Republican side, vs Kamala Harris and Tim Walz on the Democrat side.

Aram, up until president Biden’s recognition of the Armenian Genocide, and then Congress’s near unanimous affirmation, the top Armenian-American priority in advocating for our causes was recognition of the Genocide.

**Questions**:
* What are the issues that are important for the Armenian American community during these 2024 elections?
* How large is the Armenian American community estimated at?
* In what states are the Armenian American communities politically active and engaged?
* In which states are they positioned to make a difference in the outcome of the presidential, or senate or house elections?

The ANC of America is one of many influential organizations in the Armenian American community landscape, but there are only a handful of real, grassroots advocacy groups.

**Questions:**
* What is the ANCA’s strategy to influence the 2024 elections in the US, to ensure positive outcomes for our community?
* Is there cooperation across Armenian organizations for better results through solidarity?
* Is there cooperation with other community groups, to achieve greater results together?
* Not sure how correct this is but it has been commonly perceived that the Armenian community and the organizations are better connected with the Democrats than the Republicans? Has this been true in the past? If so, has that changed?


## Armenia & Artsakh

Trump was president from 2017-2021, and Harris has been VP in the white house from 2021 until now. During both administrations Armenia suffered catastrophic losses to Turkey and Azerbaijan, including the ethnic cleansing of Artsakh’s 150,000 Armenian population one year ago this month.

Trump’s administration did nothing to prevent or stop the 44-day war in 2020, despite being fully apprised of the looming war; and the current administration did nothing to prevent the ethnic cleansing and depopulation of Artsakh in 2023.

**Questions:**
* What is ANCA’s assessment and grading for these candidates, Trump and Harris?
    * Do their VPs matter?
* Does the ANCA intend to recommend one candidate or another during the 2024 elections?
* Why was nothing done to prevent the war by this administration? Was everything already being viewed through the zero sum lens of the conflict with Russia (with implied understanding that the war, regardless of outcome, would not be good for Russia)?


### Arab-American Uncommitted Movement

Since Biden’s all-in support of Israel in its war on Gaza, allocating tens of billions in aid, military and otherwise, while Israel has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, Arab-Americans have started an “Uncommitted” national movement to tell this administration that their support is not a sure thing, and they need to hear a more thoughtful and balanced US approach to the war in Gaza. One reason why their movement has legs is that Michigan, specifically the area around Dearborn, has a heavy concentration of Arab Americans who vote, and Michigan is a so-called “swing state” in the coming elections.

**Questions:**
* Do Armenians have any similar movements?
* What could the major candidates do to woo Armenian votes?
    * References to the “Lawler Bill” [H.Res.7288](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7288) and Senator Markey’s [S.Res.540](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-resolution/540).
* Armenians also have a significant presence in Michigan, would it make sense to join forces with them?
    * In exchange, we could expect the benefit of collaboration when we have causes that can use greater numbers than we have.
