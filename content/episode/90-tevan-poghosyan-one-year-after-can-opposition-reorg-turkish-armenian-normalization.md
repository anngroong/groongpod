## Discussion

## The One Year Anniversary of The War

* Lead-up to the war? When did Armenia know for sure?
* How did the war start? What do we know about the first moments of the war?
* When was it possible for Pashinyan to stop the war?
* Aliyev and Pashinyan’s addresses to the UNGA during this past week.


## Can the Opposition Reorganize?

Opposition held a candle-lit march to Yerablur. While the march was silent and not too political, many believe this will mark the restart of the street struggle by the opposition. Does the opposition have a chance to re-invigorate its struggle against the government, combining pressure on the street?

* What is the opposition doing right and what is it doing wrong?


## Turkish-Armenian Rapprochement

Mane Gevorgyan said that Armenia is ready to begin high profile discussions with Turkey.

* Erdogan and Pashinyan’s speeches in UNGA
    * Armenia did not condemn Turkey’s involvement in Artsakh war, but Cyprus did.
* Is the issue of Artsakh still the “elephant in the room” in Armenian-Turkish relations?
* Erdogan meeting with Putin next week
