In this episode of the Armenian News Network - Groong Week in Review, we speak with Ambassador Dziunik Aghajanian, a seasoned diplomat and former Armenian ambassador to the Netherlands, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This discussion delves into the most pressing geopolitical and domestic issues currently shaping Armenia's future. Topics include poignant revelations about US plans to encircle Iran, Azerbaijan’s pivotal role in this strategy, and the broader implications for the South Caucasus. 

Ambassador Aghajanian shares her unique insights into how these dynamics influence not only Armenia but also the regional balance of power. The conversation explores the historical context, current developments, and future trajectories that are critical for understanding the challenges facing Armenia today. Through her experienced perspective, we examine the intersection of Western interests, Russian influence, and local governance, gaining a deeper understanding of Armenia's precarious position amidst competing global powers. 

With critical analysis and nuanced discussion, this episode is essential listening for anyone interested in geopolitics, the South Caucasus, or international relations.
