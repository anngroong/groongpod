# “Special Protected Status for Artsakh Refugees”

Recently, the Armenian government announced that it would give a “Special Protected” status to refugees from Artsakh. The government says that this is equivalent to a status of a refugee and Artsakhtsis are not considered citizens of Armenia. Those wishing to be recognized as citizens of Armenia and enjoy benefits such as pensions and other government support must apply for citizenship.

This decision has bewildered many refugees from Artsakh who hold blue passports, just like other Armenian citizens, in which it is written that the holder of this passport is a citizen of the Republic of Armenia. The only difference for Artsakh residents is that the authority field in the passport has the code 070.

**Questions:**
* What are the differences between these statuses? What is the motivation for recognizing citizens of Artsakh as refugees, instead of citizens of Armenia or Internally DIsplaced People (IDP)?
* If Artsakhtsis want to adopt Armenian citizenship, a form has been circulated online which shows that they have to sign a declaration that they’re not a citizen of any other country. What dangers does this form carry?
* How did the Armenian government regulate issues such as voting and state service for Armenian citizens who lived in Artsakh?
* What happens to the rights of Artsakh citizens, such as right to property, or right of return, if they accept Armenian citizenship?
    * There have been reports in Azerbaijani media that Aliyev has given a deadline after which the property of Artsakhtsis who have not returned will be transferred to the government of Azerbaijan.
* Will the ratification of the Rome Statute help?
