## Overview

Over the course of this weekend and until Monday, there’s this [Global Armenian Summit](https://globalarmeniansummit.am/en) conference in progress in Yerevan. The event is organized by the office of the High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs, and invitations went out a few months ago. Reportedly there are 600 attendees [according](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1095970.html) to Armenpress, but probably taken from the conference website.
