A conversation with Areg Danagoulian and Emil Sanamyan

Recording of A live Clubhouse conversation on June 14, 2021

As part of the November 9th Agreement, Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to a number of points, one of which was the unblocking of all transportation routes in the region and opening unfettered access between Azerbaijan and Nakhijevan. The specific wording of Article 9 goes as follows:

All economic and transport connections in the region shall be unblocked. The Republic of Armenia shall guarantee the security of transport connections between the western regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in order to arrange unobstructed movement of persons, vehicles and cargo in both directions. The Border Guard Service of the Russian Federal Security Service shall be responsible for overseeing the transport connections.”

Note that the agreement does not provide for a physical corridor, but rather unfettered access to be overseen by “FSB.”  This point in the agreement has led to much contention and consternation. While Azerbaijan and Turkey have been talking about reopening of borders, Armenia has refused so far to provide the said transportation link.
