Description = """Armenian News Network - Groong Week in Review - Sep 4, 2022

Topics:
* September 2: Artsakh Independence Day
    * September 2 is a public holiday commemorating the day 31 years ago when the Nagorno Karabakh Republic declared independence from the USSR. Before 2020, this would be a festive holiday. This year, there were protests in both Yerevan and Stepanakert as well as visits to the gravesites of fallen heroes.
* Developments in Geopolitics
    * There were two major meetings this week between Armenia and Azerbaijan. On August 30, the deputy PMs met in Moscow, then on August 31, Pashinyan and Aliyev met in Brussels.
* “Normalization” with Turkey
    * Next: we’ve read reports that the fifth meeting in the Turkish Armenian “Normalization” process will occur in September, so we'll discuss the pros and cons of that process with Prof. Vahram Ter-Matevosyan.
* Remembering Mikhail Gorbachev
    * As Mikhail Gorbachev passed away this past week, we’ll talk to Prof. Ara Sanjian and also Ter-Matevosyan for their recollections of the years leading up to, and following the fall of Soviet Union in 1991.
