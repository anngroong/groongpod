## Stepanakert Rally
A day prior to the meeting, on October 30, tens of thousands of people gathered in Stepanakert’s Renaissance Square.
* What was the objective of the rally and was it achieved?
 
One of the calls heard from Renaissance Square, was an appeal to the Russian Federation to continue its endeavor to ensure security of the Artsakhtsis.
 
* How much hope is there given the recent declaration in Sochi?
 
 
## Sullivan Plan vs Putin’s Plan
 
In the analyst community it is common belief that there are two competing plans for signing a so-called “peace treaty” between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
 
The West’s plan, which Pashinyan said is also acceptable to him, involves the recognition of sovereignty of Azerbaijan over Artsakh based on the UN Charter and the 1991 Alma Ata declaration.
 
A week ago, another member of the Hayastan Dashinq, Gegham Manukyan, symbolically tore up a copy of what is commonly referred to as the “Sullivan Plan” in the Armenian National Assembly. Meanwhile, it is clear that Russia is offering its own version of principles, where Putin has given some hints that Russia would support mentioning “unique attributes” of Armenians in Karabakh as part of a peace deal. However, based on the results of the latest Sochi trilateral meeting, this position was vetoed by Azerbaijan.
 
* What is the position of the opposition on how Armenia should react to the Western and Russian proposals?
* In your discussions with your Western counterparts, do you believe that your message about self-determination of Artsakh is perceived properly by the “international community”?
 
--
 
On October 31, Pashinyan, Aliyev and Putin met in Sochi. It became clear that the sides are far from agreeing on all issues. But they did issue a statement on whatever they could agree.
 
The statement continued to put an equal weight between Azerbaijan’s maximalist agenda of security concerns vs. humanitarian issues. The statement said that demarcation and delimitation would be done based on the 1991 Alma Ata declaration, but self determination of Artsakh (which is also part of the same declaration) is completely avoided. In fact, Karabakh is not even mentioned, and even to designate the location for peacekeepers they simply mention “the location of disposition of the peacekeepers”.
 
* How do these plans offered to us by Armenia’s Western partners differ from those of the Russian plans?
* Some politicians have expressed the position that it is in the best interests of Armenia not to sign anything at this time. Do you agree? If so, how should Armenia respond to pressures from all sides to sign what would be qualified as another capitulation?
 
 
## Upcoming Protest on November 5

Following the protest in Stepanakert the Armenian opposition has announced a demonstration in Yerevan on November 5.
* Are you concerned about apathy from people?
* What explains the long pause in opposition protests?
* On Nov 5 will protesters be told to go home again and wait for further news?
* Is it still the goal of the opposition to remove Nikol Pashinyan?
