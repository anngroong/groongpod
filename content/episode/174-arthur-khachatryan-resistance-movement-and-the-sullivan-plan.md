\f0\fs32 In the analyst community it is common belief that there are two competing plans for signing a so-called \'93peace treaty\'94 between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

\f0\fs32 The West\'92s plan, which Pashinyan said is also acceptable to him, involves the recognition of sovereignty of Azerbaijan over Artsakh based on the UN Charter and the 1991 Alma Ata declaration.

Meanwhile, it is clear that Russia is offering its own version of principles, where Putin has given some hints that Russia would support mentioning \'93unique attributes\'94 of Armenians in Karabakh as part of a peace deal. However, based on the results of the latest Sochi trilateral meeting, this position was vetoed by Azerbaijan.

\f0\fs32 On October 31, Pashinyan, Aliyev and Putin met in Sochi. It became clear that the sides are far from agreeing on all issues. But they did issue a statement on whatever they could agree.

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \

\f0\fs32 The statement continued to put an equal weight between Azerbaijan\'92s maximalist agenda of security concerns vs. humanitarian issues. The statement said that demarcation and delimitation would be done based on the 1991 Alma Ata declaration, but\'a0self determination\'a0of Artsakh (which is also part of the same declaration) is completely avoided. In fact, Karabakh is not even mentioned, and even to designate the location for peacekeepers they simply mention \'93the location of disposition of the peacekeepers\'94.
