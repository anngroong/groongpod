Since Nikol Pashinyan came to power in 2018, and prior to the Artsakh war of 2020, issues around the Armenian constitution and constitutional court have been in the center of public attention. These issues have been partly fueled by one of the most prominent legal cases in recent Armenian history, the March 1 trial against Armenian president Robert Kocharyan and military leadership at the time. We'll explore issues surrounding the March 1 case, as well as legal and specifically constitutional questions related to the Nov. 9 ceasefire declaration and subsequent events.

Our guest today is:

𝐀𝐫𝐚𝐦 𝐕𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐲𝐚𝐧, who is the author of over 20 scholarly articles in the field of Constitutional Law, Criminal Law and Criminal Procedural Law. He is a PhD in Law, and is a member of the Chamber of Advocates of Armenia. He’s founder and director of JP law firm and from 2011-2018 he was in state service at the Ombudsman’s office and the Constitutional Court. Vardevanyan is a member of Robert Kocharyan’s legal team.
