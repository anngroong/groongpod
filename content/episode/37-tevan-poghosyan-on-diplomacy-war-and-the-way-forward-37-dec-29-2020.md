Description = """Since the end of the first Nagorno-Karabakh war in 1994 and for over quarter of a century, Armenia has engaged in diplomatic activity with Azerbaijan, Turkey, Russia and the West. The aim of those diplomatic initiatives was to find a solution to the conflict by engaging in direct diplomatic negotiations as well as track two diplomacy.

In September 2020, diplomatic initiatives gave way to a military one resulting in a war that reversed Armenia’s military successes and led to the signing of a cease-fire agreement which completely undermined Armenia’s position vis-a-vis Azerbaijan and Turkey.

To understand the background of Armenia’s diplomatic activities before the war as well as to look at the future of Armenia’s role in the region, today we will discuss the challenges and opportunities faced by Armenia in the last two decades as well as the way forward. 

Today we’re joined by:

𝐓𝐞𝐯𝐚𝐧 𝐏𝐨𝐠𝐡𝐨𝐬𝐲𝐚𝐧, who is President of the International Center for Human Development. Mr. Poghosyan was an MP at the National Assembly between 2012 and 2017 from the Heritage party. In 1997-1999 he served as the NKR Public Affairs Office Director in Washington, D.C.

TOPICS:

- On track two diplomacy in Armenian-Azerbaijani & Armenian-Turkish relations.
- State of the Karabakh negotiations prior to the September war.
- What were the key events that put us on a warpath?
- What factors led to Armenia losing the war?
- Internal Armenian politics. Is Armenia a failed state?
- Life in Artsakh.

Your Hosts:
- 𝐀𝐬𝐛𝐞𝐝 𝐁𝐞𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐚𝐧
- 𝐇𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐤 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐲𝐚𝐧
