# Update on the Threats to the Armenian Quarter in Jerusalem

Just to catch up on the issues around the Armenian Quarters in Jerusalem, let me point listeners to our Podcast Episodes [261](https://podcasts.groong.org/261) and [292](https://podcasts.groong.org/292) (links in the show notes) where we discussed the contract with which the Jerusalem Patriarchate reportedly granted a 98-year lease for Goveroo Bardez (Cow’s Garden), a considerable amount of space in the Armenian Quarters in Jerusalem. This shady Israeli company has been trying to [illegally land grab](https://www.newarab.com/news/armenians-jerusalem-repel-armed-israeli-settlers) a significant chunk of the Armenian Quarters.

Anyway, in May and June you [tweeted](https://x.com/SavetheArQ/status/1798710742373617747) some updates to your legal case against Xana Gardens, the company.


![Case Update Tweet](/img/episode/339/Save-the-ArQ-202406.png "Case Update Tweet")
Jerusalem District Court rejects Xana Gardens' appeal for an extension.

**Questions:**
* Hagop, can you give us an update on the current situation of the Armenian Quarters in Jerusalem?
* Describe your case in Jerusalem district court, to stop Xana Gardens from invading the Goveroo Bardez.
* Why did the district court reject Xana Garden’s appeal to grant them more time?
* Where do we go from here? What are your expectations?


On Friday Armenia officially [recognized](https://www.azatutyun.am/a/33003853.html) the State of Palestine. Israel reportedly summoned the Armenian ambassador and warned Armenia of “consequences”.

**Questions:**
* How do you think relations between Armenia and Israel affect your case or the Armenian Quarter in general?
* How do the actions by the Republic of Armenia affect the Armenians of Jerusalem and Israel in general? For example, do you expect any effect on your community due to the recognition of Palestine by Armenia just this past week?
