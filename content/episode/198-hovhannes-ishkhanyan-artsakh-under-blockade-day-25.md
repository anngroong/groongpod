## Discussion

### Apathy and Indifference

The blockade of Artsakh is 25 days old. More than 120K people are at risk of being famished.

Yet, in Yerevan and Armenia in general life goes on as usual. On NY’s eve, as the clock struck 12, fireworks were launched all over the city. The entire city seemed to be one big Disneyland. Watching the fireworks was most surreal from Yerablur.

**Questions:**

* Do you think this is normal? 
* Does the Armenian government have a responsibility to set the public’s mood?
    * For instance, a popular liberal veteran journalist recently said that only dictatorships control public moods. But then we see cities like Warsaw, Poland canceling NY fireworks partly in support of Ukrainians.
* Are the Armenian people indifferent, or apathetic, or tuned out of the unfolding politics around Armenia and the region? Have they given up, or lost hope?
* What do you think is the cause for the passivity in Yerevan towards the plight of the Artakhtsis.

### Armenian Government Helpless?

The Armenian authorities are prone to blaming anyone they can find for the situation that has been created. At times they’ve blamed the voters, other times they’ve [blamed](https://www.azatutyun.am/a/32204447.html) Russia and the Russian peacekeeping force.

Simultaneous to this, Armenia says that Artsakh is no longer their problem and turns to France, the US, or the EU for help, including sending in peacekeepers or observer missions.

**Question**: 

* How do you find the Armenian government’s response? Does Armenia have any other responsibilities besides just calling for help and spreading blame?

### Aghavno

Hovhannes, earlier in 2022 as news about the potential of ceding Aghavno/Berdzor surfaced, a group of artists including yourself went to Aghavno to stay there and raise awareness of the situation among the Armenian public. In fact, I visited for you and I left a few days prior to Aghavno being emptied, while you stayed until the end.

**Questions:**

* Can you describe your experience in Aghavno/Berdzor?
* Do you see any connection between the Aghavno/Berdzor events and what is going on today?
* Can you describe how the creative, artist or sports community in Armenia have reacted, or acted, to the ongoing crisis surrounding Armenia  1- for two years now, and 2- in the last month that this blockade has been draining Artsakh?
    * Have these communities had an effect on the public mood and disposition towards the unfolding tragedy of the past two years or month?
