# In the Wake of the Georgian Election

## Election Outcome

To sum up the results, the ruling party Georgian Dream got around 54 percent of the votes, while 4 opposition parties overcame the 5 percent threshold. Despite criticism, the OSCE and international observers have essentially accepted the election results and are ready to work with the new government.

Not so with the US (and supported by the [EU](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/28/eu-calls-for-swift-probe-of-alleged-georgian-election-irregularities)). Secretary of State Blinken [called](https://civil.ge/archives/631791) for a full investigation into “breaches of international norms” during the elections. In that vein, Georgian president Salome Zourabishvili and the opposition parties are [rejecting](https://www.rferl.org/a/georgia-parliamentary-vote-violence-intimidation-russia-west/33175194.html) the election results, and also alleging that there was Russian interference without providing supporting evidence. She and umbrella civil society NGO “My Vote” are [alleging](https://civil.ge/archives/631251) systematic and massive voter fraud affecting over 300,000 votes, and demanding the annulment of the election results.

**Questions:**

* What’s your assessment of the situation on the ground 4 days after the elections?
* Have you seen evidence of external interference?
    * If yes: who? What was the outcome?
* Is there any direct evidence that Russia rigged the elections, that votes were stolen during the elections?
* Is there a gap in the attitudes of the US vs the EU, regarding acceptance of these election results?
* Is it a good thing or a bad thing that the ruling party fell short of achieving a parliamentary supermajority?

### Regional Votes

Georgia has 3-4 major cities and 3-4 major regions or provinces. Armenians were especially tuned into the region of Samtskhe-Javakheti, just north of the Armenian border, where over half the population is Armenian. But there are also Adjaria, the Marneuli region with a strong Azeri population, etc. Interestingly, Georgian Dream got an overwhelming majority both in Armenian and Azeri communities.

**Questions:**

* Are the populations in the regions engaged in the political life of Georgia? Why did Armenians vote overwhelmingly for GD?
* Some pro-EU Georgian politicians appeared to blame minorities, including Armenians, for the GD victory, such as when Zurabichvili used the term “Armenian carousel”. Is this an isolated event or is anti-Armenian xenophobia or politicization of the Armenian voters a common occurrence in Georgian politics?


## Georgia - Armenia Strategic Partnership

Questions:

* What is this strategic partnership about?
* Is there a document or treaty signed? Or just a declaration?
* Why was defense explicitly excluded from the agreement?

## Effect on Armenia and Beyond

With Georgia shifting to a more balanced foreign policy, is it time for Armenia also to move away from a black-and-white pro-western policy in the region, to a more balanced approach? While all the other countries do not want to see western presence in the south caucasus, Armenia is the only one introducing them, so - is it time to reconsider?

**Questions:**

* How does this Georgian election outcome affect Armenia?
