## Living With Conflict #WordsNotSwords {#living-with-conflict-#wordsnotswords}

### Overview {#overview}

From July 12 to July 17 Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed on their border, killing tens of servicemen and civilians from both sides. In the following week the press and propaganda from both sides picked up in an effort to align international opinion and sympathies on their side, and some demonstrations in cities around the world got out of hand, resulting in violence between protestors, injuries and arrests. 

Even more worrisome, the violence spilled over to ordinary citizens and businesses in some diaspora communities. According to media reports restaurants and other businesses in Moscow were attacked by groups from opposing sides. Individual Azerbaijanis and Armenians, including children, were targets of random attacks. In some cases, humiliating videos of the victims being beaten were posted on social media. In Moscow police arrested over 30 people connected to the violence. We also read reports of vandalism of an Armenian [school](https://www.facebook.com/groups/groong/?post_id=10163778097325585) in San Francisco, attacks against individuals and businesses around the world, including [Turkey](https://www.facebook.com/groups/groong/permalink/10163800487835585/), [Germany](https://www.facebook.com/groups/groong/permalink/10163796362525585/), other places in Europe and in the [US](https://www.facebook.com/groups/groong/permalink/10163786719465585/).

Observers indicate that this level of animosity between communities did not exist even during the worst days of war. The violence in the diaspora led some scholars, both Azerbaijani and Armenian, to call on their respective communities to renounce from street violence and re-engage in peaceful activism.


We are joined today by some of the initiating signatories of that call:
* Dr. [Artyom Tonoyan](https://twitter.com/artyomtonoyan) - Originally from Gyumri, Armenia, Dr. Artyom Tonoyan is a Research Associate at the University of Minnesota's Center for Holocaust & Genocide Studies, where his research is focused on the nexus of religion and violence.

Arzu has written for Al Jazeera, Eurasianet, Foreign Policy Democracy Lab, Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty, CODA and more. She is a contributor at Open Democracy, IWPR, and Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso.
* [Ulvi Ismayil](https://twitter.com/ulvi_ismayil) - Ulvi is a historian and researcher, based in Washington, D.C. and originally from Baku. He works with international development organizations such as UNHCR and USAID and has been involved in Azerbaijan-Armenian peace-making multilateral projects since 2004. He has written on the subject and has even developed his own peace proposal.  Ulvi was a co-author of a joint petition drafted in 2014 calling the sides to observe peace along the line of contact.
* [Emil Sanamyan](https://twitter.com/emil_sanamyan) - Emil Sanamyan, who is a senior research fellow at USC’s Institute of Armenian Studies specializing in politics in the Caucasus, with a special focus on Azerbaijan. He is a regular contributor to ANN/Groong.
* [Diana Yayloyan](https://twitter.com/Diana_Yayloyan) - Diana Yayloyan is a Research Associate at the Ankara-based think tank TEPAV, working on Armenia-Turkey civil society dialogue supported by the European Union.

## Panel Discussion on Robert Kocharyan’s Interview {#panel-discussion-on-robert-kocharyan’s-interview}

### Overview {#overview}

In July, former President Robert Kocharyan gave an interview to 3 news sources (5րդ Ալիք, Հ2, and Yerkir Media) where he talked about issues ranging from internal politics to NKR conflict and regional developments.

We are joined by our resident panel, Asbed Kotchikian, Emil Sanamyan and Alen Zamanyan.

## Lightning Round {#lightning-round}

### The SIS Charges Arthur Danielyan {#the-sis-charges-arthur-danielyan}

This week the SIS brought charges against Arthur Danielyan for the fight with Alen Simonyan in the streets of Yerevan. No charges have been leveled against Alen Simonyan.


### Nominees for the Constitutional Court {#nominees-for-the-constitutional-court}

A faction of ANC members and supporters of former president Levon Ter-Petrosyan  have[ criticized the government’s nominee to the Constitutional Court](https://www.facebook.com/groups/groong/permalink/10163781674650585/), Vahram Avetisian. They say that his father was linked to former regimes, passing several judgements on cases related to the March 1, 2008 events which Vahram Avetisian has never condemned.

The Supreme Judicial Council[ elected](https://www.facebook.com/groups/groong/permalink/10163808312280585/) Yervand Khundkaryan, who is currently chairman of Court of Cassation, as their nominee for one of the three vacant seats in the Constitutional Court. 

And Gor Hovhannisyan, a German legal scholar who was already nominated once for the constitutional court in 2019, has said  that president Sarkissian’s office[ had reached out to him again](https://www.facebook.com/groups/groong/permalink/10163808177210585/).

We discuss these nominations.


### The PM’s Outlook on the State of the Pandemic {#the-pm’s-outlook-on-the-state-of-the-pandemic}

Prime Minister Pashinyan this week declared that the situation over[ coronavirus has significantly improved](https://www.facebook.com/groups/groong/permalink/10163790374680585/) in Armenia. He has also expressed hopes that the state of emergency can be lifted by September. This perception is based on data from recent days when the recovery rate has outpaced new infection rate. Do the statistics support the Prime Minister’s declaration?


## Staff Changes in the High  Commissioner’s Office {#staff-changes-in-the-high-commissioner’s-office}

This week the High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs, Zareh Sinanyan, is in Los Angeles on vacation. However back in Yerevan the Prime Minister fired most of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs. What’s going on?
