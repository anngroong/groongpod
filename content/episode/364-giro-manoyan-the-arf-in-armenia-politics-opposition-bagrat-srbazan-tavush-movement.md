# The ARF in Armenia’s Politics

## Role of the Opposition

In 2021 the ARF helped form the Hayastan Dashinq, or Armenia Alliance and entered the National Assembly along with Pativ Unem as the 2 main opposition political forces.

Unfortunately, the ruling party was able to win a supermajority, passing laws at will, while the opposition has struggled to block measures harmful to Armenia’s national interests. Since the 2021 elections, opposition figures have faced arrests, particularly mayors, the legal system has been purged, and unconstitutional concessions have been made to Azerbaijan. In short, the opposition has been largely ineffective.

**Questions:**
* How do you assess the role of the opposition in Armenia, especially the ARF and Hayastan Dashinq?
* In hindsight, should the opposition have participated in the 2021 elections?

We are a week away from the first anniversary of the ethnic cleansing of Artsakh, which resulted in the complete forceful ethnic cleansing of Artsakh. To this day we have dozens of hostages in Baku, including the head of the ARF in Artsakh, Davit Ishkhanyan. Yet, we also hear this criticism that the Armenian opposition, 10 days before September 19 was calmly participating in the sittings of the Armenian National Assembly, discussing mundane agendas. And similarly, 10 days after the ethnic cleansing of Artsakh, the opposition was in the national assembly, business as usual.

**Questions:**
* Is this a fair criticism?
* What is necessary for the opposition to become more effective going forward?
* What changes can we expect in the fall, towards a more successful parliamentary opposition?
* Does the opposition continue to seek a change of the current government?
* At what point does the ARF’s participation in the national assembly, as a minor opposition party, become an endorsement of the political system that rubber stamps Pashinyan initiatives, including the potential ratification of a so-called “peace treaty” with Azerbaijan?
    * What benefit is there to stay in the national assembly in this climate?
    * Previously various ARF representatives have said that ratification of the peace treaty is a red line and the ARF will lay down mandates if it comes to that. Is that position still in force?
* Has the Parliament debated whether Pashinyan should attend COP29 in Baku?


## Tavush Movement

Since April, Srbazan Bagrat Galstanyan has led a movement, Tavush for the Homeland,  protesting territorial concessions in Tavush, which quickly grew nationwide. Tens of thousands took to the streets, and the government responded with violent force, injuring over 80 people, including journalists. The parliamentary opposition has supported Srbazan, offering logistical help. He has announced that the movement will resume in the fall.

**Questions:**
* Does the ARF support Bagrat Srbazan’s movement? How?
* A couple of days ago Bagrat Srbazan said that he [met](https://verelq.am/hy/node/149691) with Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan ahead of the Sep 22 town hall. What was discussed?
