## Discussion

### Artsakh Blockade Day 9

Here we are on Day 9 of the Artsakh Blockade that Azerbaijan has imposed on 120 thousand of our compatriots.

The Turkish-Azeri alliance took advantage of a time when Russia is tied up dealing with their war in Ukraine, and needs to manage some unsavory relationships that it needs right now; specifically: Turkey.

So the Russian peacekeepers were put in a very precarious position when Azerbaijan blocked the Lachin corridor with pretend “eco-environmental” protesters. There are reports that these demonstrators are intelligence and defense workers and they’re in fact under the protection of Azeri police and defense forces.

**Questions:**



* What can Russia do to remove the blockade? What are the constraints on Russia in dealing with this crisis?
* How do you assess the job that the peacekeepers are doing?
* What should the peacekeepers do that they are not doing?


### The Role of the Armenian Government

Pashinyan’s government seems to be content mostly with just complaining to any sympathetic European and American diplomat or politician, but there is no real action on their part to deal with this blockade, except making the most possible noise in blaming the Russian peacekeepers for a failure to secure the Lachin corridor.

Regardless of blame, we were very sad to hear yesterday (Monday) that [one patient died](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1100035.html) in the hospital in Stepanakert, because it was impossible to get him through the blockade in time. There are additional ICU patients and children who need immediate care beyond what’s available in Artsakh.

**Questions:**



* What do you think is the role of the Armenian government in securing the safety of 120,000 of our compatriots in Artsakh?

Pashinyan’s government would have the Armenian people believe that the West will ride into the South Caucasus to save the Armenians. The US, the French, the EU.



* Can the Armenian government rely on the international community when fundamental UN international order is [not observed](https://a1plus.am/hy/article/446325) in our region?
* Even with a sympathetic public and leadership, physically speaking, what could the US, or France or the EU do to help Armenia in its current, immediately dangerous situation?
* Is it even in the political and economic interests of “The West” to help Armenia, at a time when they’re locked in a strategic war with its traditional ally and patron, Russia?


### Lachin, Zangezur, Sevan, Yerevan

Many analysts believe that closing Lachin is the first step by the Turkish-Azeri alliance towards forcing Armenia to relinquish Artsakh, and then agree to the so-called Zangezur corridor. They talk about Zangezur, then Sevan, then Yerevan, all without tanks. A [recent poll](https://azertag.az/xeber/Azerbaycan_ehalisi_Zengezur_dehlizinin_yaxin_zamanda_achilacagina_inanir___Sorgu-2412164) in Azerbaijan apparently indicates that 63% of Azeris believe that the corridor is essentially a done deal; it will happen. And articles in their press say that Artsakh understands that soon [there will be Azeri police in Stepanakert](https://caliber.az/en/post/130866/).

**Questions:**

* What is the plan and strategy behind Azerbaijan’s blockade?
* Why has Pashinyan and his government washed its hands of Artsakh?
