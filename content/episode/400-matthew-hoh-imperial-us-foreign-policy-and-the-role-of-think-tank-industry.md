In this episode of *Conversations on Groong*, we dive deep into the intricate dynamics of U.S. imperial foreign policy with Capt. Matthew Hoh. A distinguished Marine Corps officer, former diplomat, and outspoken anti-war advocate, Capt. Hoh offers a comprehensive perspective on the motivations, strategies, and consequences of America’s global military engagements. This discussion sheds light on how the U.S. wields its power across the world and the critical role of think tanks in shaping policies that influence global conflicts. By drawing on his personal experiences and professional expertise, Capt. Hoh exposes the often-hidden realities behind the U.S. Empire’s far-reaching actions, offering a thought-provoking analysis of its impact on nations like Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine, and raising essential questions about the ethics and future of such policies.

- How think tanks influence U.S. military policy and decision-making
- Detailed case studies: Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine as theaters of conflict
- The RAND Corporation, its strategies, and its role in the Military-Industrial Complex
- The broader implications of U.S. policy on global stability and emerging powers

5. How do think tanks and defense industry lobbying drive U.S. military strategies?
6. How do other geopolitical players like Russia and China compare in terms of imperial ambitions and strategies?
