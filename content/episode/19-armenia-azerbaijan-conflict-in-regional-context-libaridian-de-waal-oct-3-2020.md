Description = """Conversations on Groong - October 3, 2020

It has now been 7 days since Azerbaijan initiated a wide-scale attack against Armenia and Artsakh. The tragic news of deaths and destruction continue to stream in every hour.

In today’s conversation on Groong, we talk to Jirair Libaridian and Thomas DeWaal about the regional geopolitics that helped create a ripe environment for renewed fighting and various potential scenarios that may develop as a result of it.

- Why has Turkey taken an active role in the conflict?
- Was Russia caught off-guard with the escalation?
- Does the OSCE Minsk Process matter anymore?
- How does Iran factor in the conflict?
