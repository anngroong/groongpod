## Azerbaijan Blocks Corridor Checkpoint after Shootings

Today Azerbaijan [banned](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1113331.html) all humanitarian passenger and cargo through the Lachin Corridor, following shootings near the Hakari bridge that injured soldiers on both sides.

**Question:**
* What is the status?


## Has Artsakh “returned to the negotiation table”?

Pashinyan’s government is touting its Artsakh policy, that they have returned Artsakh to the negotiations table.

**Question:**
* Is there any evidence in Stepanakert that Nagorno Karabakh is at the table?


## International actions viewed from Stepanakert

The European parliament held a [discussion](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1113068.html) about the blockade. In the US, Rep. Adam Schiff [wrote](https://asbarez.com/schiff-urges-biden-to-defend-democracy-and-human-rights-in-armenia-and-artsakh/) to Biden, urging him to act quickly to help Artsakh. 

**Question:**
* What’s the view from Stepanakert of such activities, let’s say including the ICJ ruling back in February, ordering Azerbaijan to cease and desist from the blockade?


## Noting the half-year mark of the blockade

This week was the half year mark since Azerbaijan cruelly blockaded Artsakh from the outside world.

This week  the Artsakh ombudsman’s office published its [updated report](https://artsakhombuds.am/en/document/1028) of human rights violations against Artsakh citizens, including data from the blockade so far. Some of the [main points](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1113078.html) include, and this is just a very high level summary, you can check the links in our show notes to find the actual data:

* Vastly reduced movement of passengers and goods between Artsakh and Armenia; and when we say “vastly” we’re talking about an over 99% reduction here, not a reduction of a few percentage points.
* Vastly diminished economic activity
* Vastly increased joblessness and job loss.
    * Job loss is estimated at over 11,000 jobs, and we’re talking here about a country of about 150,000 reduced now to 120,000. Assuming a 50% labor size of 60,000 people, this means that approximately 1 person in 6 lost their job and livelihood.
* No gas for 4 months straight.
* No electricity from outside for over 5 months straight.

**Questions:**

* What is the experience of daily life?
* How is the common Artsakh citizen surviving this calamity day in and day out?
