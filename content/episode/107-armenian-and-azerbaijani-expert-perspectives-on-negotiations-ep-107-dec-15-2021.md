Description:

In this Conversations on Groong episode, we'll be talking with two specialists from Armenia and from Azerbaijan, and explore their views and perspectives on the problems and solutions they envision for long-term peace between the neighbors.

Since the second war in Artsakh in 2020, also known as the 44-Day war, which culminated in the signing of the November Agreement by Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia, the three countries have been negotiating the fulfillment of that agreement. The agreement contained 9 points, of which the first 5 are primarily complete, 6 and 7 are more or less in progress, but 8 and 9 continue to be deeply problematic despite intensive and contentious yearlong negotiations.

What are the perspectives and stumbling blocks that have prevented peace, a year after the war ended?

Why is there a need to have such a discussion right now? The temperature of the post-war negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan has reached a boiling point, with Azerbaijan's president Aliyev issuing ultimatums and demands for dates for Armenia to open "corridors" for Azerbaijan. In trying to create a more informed Armenian public about these negotiations, we hope that such discussions can clarify what the sides are saying to each other, and what the sides are hearing from each other.
