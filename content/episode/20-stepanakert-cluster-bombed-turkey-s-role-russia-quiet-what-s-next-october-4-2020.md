## The Only Topic This Week: War on Artsakh!

This episode of the podcast was fully devoted to the war in Artsakh. It was recorded on the morning of Saturday, Oct 3 Pacific time while one of our guests, Varuzhan Geghamyan was in Stepanakert as the city was undergoing constant bombardment.

Unfortunately, the air assault on Stepanakert and other civilian areas of Artsakh seems to have only intensified with more active use of cluster bombs, long-range missiles and suicide drones. As of early Monday morning (Pacific time) we have confirmed that Varuzhan is OK though he communicated that the situation is dangerous as the city is still under constant bombardment.

The use of cluster munitions, let alone targeting of civilian structures, is prohibited by international law and it seems that the dictator in Baku, Ilham Aliyev, is intent to level the city to the ground. As of this time, according to the Artsakh foreign ministry, 19 civilians have been killed, 80 wounded, and over 2700 property and civilian infrastructure has been damaged. We’re worried about the safety of Artsakh’s peaceful civilian population and urge you to raise awareness of this travesty among your non-Armenian friends and elected representatives.

For a week now, our focus here at Groong has been the war. What started in the early morning of Sunday 27th of September as an all out attack on the line of contact quickly escalated into a large scale war, with Azerbaijan attacking civilian targets in both Artsakh and in Armenia.

On October 3rd we published a conversation we had with Jirair Libaridian and Tom de Waal exploring the meta-analysis of the conflict which you may also find interesting. So check out Episode 19 for that recording.

Today we will discuss with our analysts from Armenia, Artsakh and the US some of the developments and the outlook around the ongoing war.

#### Varuzhan

Life under fire in Stepanakert and other parts of Artsakh. How are people handling the militarized environment, what is daily life like for the past week?

#### Marine

Just days before the fighting she was planning to be in Artsakh to visit family. Impressions from Yerevan and Armenia?

#### Asbed Kotchikian

A brief synopsis of the discussion with Jirair Libaridian and Tom de Waal on this issue yesterday. What is driving Turkish activation toward the Caucasus? Does Turkey want to be directly involved in a conflict in Armenia?

#### Emil

What are the factors on the Armenian and Azerbaijani sides that will determine the duration and intensity of the war?  What are some potential scenarios on how this war can progress?
