This episode of the podcast was fully devoted to the war in Artsakh. It was recorded on the morning of Saturday, Oct 3 Pacific time while one of our guests, Varuzhan Geghamyan was in Stepanakert as the city was undergoing constant bombardment.

Unfortunately, the air assault on Stepanakert and other civilian areas of Artsakh seems to have only intensified with more active use of cluster bombs, long-range missiles and suicide drones. As of early Monday morning (Pacific time) we have confirmed that Varuzhan is OK though he communicated that the situation is dangerous as the city is still under constant bombardment.

The use of cluster munitions, let alone targeting of civilian structures, is prohibited by international law and it seems that the dictator in Baku, Ilham Aliyev, is intent to level the city to the ground. As of this time, according to the Artsakh foreign ministry, 19 civilians have been killed, 80 wounded, and over 2700 property and civilian infrastructure has been damaged. We’re worried about the safety of Artsakh’s peaceful civilian population and urge you to raise awareness of this travesty among your non-Armenian friends and elected representatives.
