## Raising Flags: Alison on Recent Events in Tegh and Across Armenia

### Aghavno / Berdzor

In August 2022, you were with a group of friends in Aghavno and called for followers to join you in an attempt to prevent the handover of Berdzor/Aghavno to Azerbaijan.

**Questions:**

* Are these events, Berdzor, Aghavno, Jermuk, now Tegh, a consequence of policies of the Armenian government?

### April 11 Azeri Aggression Near Tegh

The unprovoked Azeri shootings of April 11 killed 4 of our soldiers near Tegh village. A week ago [we talked with Naira Melikyan](https://podcasts.groong.org/245), mother of fallen soldier Hayk Melikyan, who tried to visit this region with other concerned parents and activists, and she was prevented by Armenian border guards, who claimed to be stopping her “for her own safety”.

Naira reported that Azeris were building fortifications on Armenian territory, and wanted to see what is going on there. So she was clearly aware of something suspicious going on, and a few days later Azeri shootings killed four of our soldiers. It’s unbelievable that a private citizen can sense the trouble we’re in, yet the government turns a complete blind eye to the safety of Armenian soldiers and citizens, probably even colluding with the enemy in order to fulfill secret agreements that they signed behind the backs of the Armenian people.

**Questions:**

* What’s your perspective on what has happened near Tegh?
* What is the situation near the Kornidzor bridge, and the new road built by Pashinyan’s government that leads to the Berdzor corridor?

### Azeri Infiltrations into Armenia

Earlier this past week two soldiers were reported to have [crossed into Armenia](https://www.azatutyun.am/a/32357619.html) from their posts in Nakhijevan. Armenpress reported them as having “[gone missing](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1108303.html)”. One person was [found and arrested](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1108306.html) the same day, and yesterday the second of the two [was apprehended](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1108608.html).

**Questions:**

* Having recently visited Sisian and the region in general, what are your thoughts on these incidents?
* Are the communities in the south safe?
* Are Armenia’s border guards doing their job?

## Activities

Hovik, please put a couple of lines from Alison’s activities here, I do not recall all that she said. For example, your question about her Flag raising rallies, etc. Just 2-3 lines at most, the rest: people can listen to the show.

Alison mentioned the flag [raising rallies in Ardanish](https://hetq.am/hy/article/154483).
