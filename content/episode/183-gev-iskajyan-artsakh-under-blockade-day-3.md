For three days now the campaign instigated by the government of Azerbaijan has prevented the freedom of movement of Armenians of Artsakh.  Gas supplies have also been cut off.

“Artsakh is still Armenian land. Artsakh is still an independent republic. Artsakh is not gone. ... We have to hold on to what remains of this land here.” - Gev Iskajyan

## Gev Iskajyan

We’re now talking to Gev Iskajyan, representative of the ANC in Artsakh.

Gev, we are now entering day 3 of the complete transportation blockade of Artsakh and the 2nd day of energy blockade. 

**Q: Can you brief us about the current humanitarian situation on the ground?**



* Is there food rationing?
* What is the situation with schools?

**Q: Are you aware of any political goals from Azerbaijan?**

As far as I’m aware, so far the EU spokesperson has called on Azerbaijan distinctly to cease the blockade. The United States has issued a similar statement. Today, the Russian peacekeepers daily report directly blamed Azerbaijan for the blockade of Artsakh. However, other organizations, for example the UN have been silent. 

**Q: Overall, is the quality and quantity of these responses satisfactory?**



* Why are they silent?
* What are your expectations? Will words just suffice?

**Q: What is your assessment on the work of the Russian peacekeepers?**



* Are Russian peacekeepers helping with providing fuel?
* Is food aid at least being provided by Russians?

There’s been criticism that Armenian society is completely passive and there is a sense of helplessness about the situation.

**Q:  Would you agree with this? What is your call to Armenians worldwide?**

News reports from Azerbaijan indicate that the provocateurs tonight will continue their blockade.

**Q: Are there any indications that the blockade will cease anytime soon?**
