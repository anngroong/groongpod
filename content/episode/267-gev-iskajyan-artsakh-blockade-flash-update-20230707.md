## Catastrophic Situation in Artsakh

Artsakh HR Ombudsman Gegham Stepanyan says that the situation has become “catastrophic”. 

* Stores running out of supplies (including cigarettes)
* “Since June 15, we’ve had 0 tons of humanitarian goods”
* “Only ICRC is able to transport a small number of medical patients and bring in limited medical supplies”
* “Threat of starvation is higher now” than any other time during the 6 month blockade.
* Starvation may come in 10 days


Maria Zakharova [said](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1114829.html) “The humanitarian situation in [Nagorno-Karabakh] is deteriorating. Regrettably we have to note that due to the suspension of supplies the population could be left without food, other essential products and medication.” She called on Azerbaijan to lift the blockade.
\
US Ambassador to Armenia Kristina Kvien says the US “believes and hopes” that people in Artsakh can live in Azerbaijan with their security and rights observed. Stepanakert did not take her comments quietly and [responded](https://www.azatutyun.am/a/32490708.html) to her that Artsakh remains on a course to self-determination.


## Discussion on Hakari Video Fiasco

Why do Unedited, and Pashinyan-released and edited versions of the videos showing the Hakari bridge shootings yield different conclusions?


## Azeri Preconditions for Baku-Stepanakert Talks

Reports that Artsakh rejected an offer to have a Western mediated discussion between Baku and Stepanakert.

Aliyev is demanding demilitarization of Artsakh
* Arayik Harutyunyan said that Azerbaijan is putting a precondition of demilitarization before negotiations can begin.
* Another precondition is that negotiations will be about integration. Only.
* Azeri public TV are threatening operation “Revenge-3” (or is it Retribution-3)


## ANCA Supported NDAA in Congress

[NDAA](https://armenianweekly.com/2023/07/01/anca-backs-ndaa-amendments-to-save-artsakh-and-sanction-azerbaijan/) in Congress - 13 different provisions introduced by US congressmen, including:
* Funding for artsakh
* Reporting on situation on a monthly basis
* Punitive measures against Baku
