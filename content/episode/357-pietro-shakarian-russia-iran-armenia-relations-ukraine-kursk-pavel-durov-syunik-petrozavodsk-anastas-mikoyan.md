## Russia and Iran in a North-South Axis

Russian Iranian relations have never been closer than they’ve been since the war in Ukraine began. The Russian, Ottoman and Persian empires have always clashed in the South Caucasus and traded territories between them, but it’s only since the fall of the Soviet Union, and perhaps more specifically since the fall and ethnic cleansing of Artsakh that Russia has recognized how strategic its relations are with Iran, in the modern world.

**Questions:**
* How would you characterize Russian-Iranian relations at this stage?
* What is the importance of Armenia in the Iran-Russia North-South “axis”?
* Is it possible for Azerbaijan to “replace” Armenia in the Iran-Russia North-South “axis”?


## War with Ukraine

It's been almost a month since Ukraine initiated a surprise invasion of Russia’s Kursk region and captured a number of towns and villages, before Russia started reacting. The 2.5 year old war in Ukraine has turned into a war of attrition, so from a resource and strategic perspective, on the surface this adventure doesn’t seem to make any sense, but from a… “chutzpah” perspective I guess Zelensky is showing Putin that not only is he not about to roll over and surrender, but he has the energy to mount counter offensives.

**Questions:**
* What’s your take on this “Kursk gambit”? What are the potential upsides and downsides for the sides?
* Where do things stand now? How do you expect this to end?
* Do you see an end to the war in Ukraine?


## Arrest of Pavel Durov

Last week Russian entrepreneur and IT magnate [Pavel Durov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov) was arrested in France. Durov is the man behind social media apps like Telegram and VK, and has had run-ins with the Russian government for refusing to turn over customer data. Last week he was arrested in France. The [charges](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pavel-durov-has-nothing-hide-telegram-says-arrested-founder-2024-08-26/) are that his Telegram app, which is not moderated or censored, is acting as a conduit for pedophilia and drug trafficking. And even though French president Macron [says](https://armenpress.am/en/article/1198363) the arrest is not politically motivated, it’s hard to not think of the Julian Assange case, with Wikileaks.

**Question:**
* What did you make of this arrest? Is it part of the Russia-West proxy wars?


## On the ground in Armenia and Russia


### Observations in Armenia

When we first connected to do a show, you told us that you’d been traveling recently, in Armenia and in Russia.

**Question:**
* What were you doing in Armenia, where did you visit, can you tell us your impressions from your trip?

Read Pietro Shakarian’s recent article titled: **[ACURA Exclusive: Pietro A. Shakarian: Armenia and Georgia: A Tale of Two Neighbors](https://usrussiaaccord.org/pietro-a-shakarian-armenia-and-georgia-a-tale-of-two-neighbors/)**.



### Observations in Russia

After a year at the AUA, you’ve been based in St. Petersburg for the past over a year.

**Questions:**
* Do you visit around Russia as well, especially areas where you can find Armenian culture and heritage?
* Where is Petrozavodsk?
* Are there parallels between the Armenian and Russian countrysideS?
