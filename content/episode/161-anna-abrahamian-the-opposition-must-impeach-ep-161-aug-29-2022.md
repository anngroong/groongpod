Conversation with Anna Abrahamian

In the spring and summer of 2022 the Armenian parliamentary opposition was in the streets of Yerevan in large numbers, with a goal to remove the de-facto prime minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan. That failed, or at least did not achieve all of the goals it had set for itself.

Especially as we near the end of August and the protests are set to restart, we’re analyzing what didn’t work, and how to take more effective steps forward. We want to look at specific issues such as whether to move for impeachment or not.

To talk about this issue, today we have Anna Abrahamian, who is a geopolitical analyst currently splitting her time between Moscow and Athens. 

Guest:  Anna Abrahamian
