Description = """Armenian News Network - Groong Week in Review - Sep 18, 2022

Topics:

-- 00:00:00 Introduction

-- 00:03:31 Azerbaijani Aggression: As many expected, Azerbaijan commenced a violent war against Armenia on September 13. There are hundreds of casualties including civilians and Armenian territories that have fallen in the hands of the aggressor. A fragile cease-fire is in place for now. We’ll analyze with our guests the basic facts and try to make sense of what happened.

-- 00:11:04 Russia and CSTO: The troubling aggression by Azerbaijan brought more troubles to Armenia’s relationship with Russia and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) which so far is not sending any military aid but will only send a fact-finding mission to Armenia. Do Armenians (including our leadership) have unrealistic expectations from the organization? Listen to us to find out.

- 00:41:24 UN & International Reaction: Next, we’ll analyze international reaction to the attack including Armenia’s appeal to the UN Security Council as well as interests of Armenia’s Southern neighbor Iran.

- 00:54:35 War Communications (Karen Vrtanesyan): How did the Armenian government communicate with the public. Is the Armenian government trying to conceal the scale and impact of the Azerbaijani attack? 

- 01:07:13 Nancy Pelosi (Suren Sargsyan): A high profile congressional delegation visited Armenia this week, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We’ll get analysis from our experts on what this means for US-Armenia relations.
