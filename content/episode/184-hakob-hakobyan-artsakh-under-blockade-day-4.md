## Hakob Hakobyan (in Armenian)

We are now on the fourth day of this illegal blockade of Artsakh by Azerbaijan. No one can enter or leave Artsakh for 4 days and Artsakhtsis have been without gas for three days. 

We will discuss this issue today with the leader of the Artsakh’s justice party, Hakob Hakobyan. Welcome Hakob.

Q: How would you describe the situation on the ground in Artsakh? 

There have been numerous reports that in order to unblock the Lachin corridor the Azerbaijani side has demanded access to the Kashen mine. In fact, there were media reports that the rights to the Kashen mine have been sold to foreign companies.

Q: Is there any truth to these reports?

* Are you aware of any other demands?
* How is Artsakh’s government reacting to this? Is there any negotiation currently with the Azerbaijani side on their demands?

Q: Do you have any hope of the “international community” intervening? How do you see the potential of international humanitarian efforts to help Artsakh? 

* How did you find Maria Zakharova’s statement today, where she claimed that the blockade of the road resulted due to disagreements on usage of mined ore.
