## Artsakh Surrenders As Armenia Watches

We have warned our listeners for three years now that Armenia under Pashinyan is headed down a disastrous roadmap and path of surrendering Artsakh, not protecting the ancestral lands of the indigenous Armenians of Artsakh, and leading to their depopulation.

Pashinyan’s talk of the “rights and security” of Artsakhtsis is now clear to everyone: it was bullshit, he hasn’t raised a finger to defend them. The EU’s talk of “rights and security” was bullshit, we haven’t heard or seen anything from the hypocrite Charles Michel, and the same from the US.

So far, the the west’s “lowering the bar on Artsakh” has meant that they wanted to allow Azerbaijan to commit and get away with Genocide.

In the past week, over 100,000 Armenians have forcibly left their homeland of thousands of years. Anywhere else in this world this is called genocide, but because major power interests dictate otherwise, the world is silent, 

**Questions:**
* Your thoughts?
* Is the Artsakh conflict over? Is Artsakh as we know it since the fall of the Soviet Union finished?

Abandoned by everyone, first and foremost by Pashinyan’s Armenia, Artsakh president Samvel Shahramanyan met with Azeri authorities and signed the dissolution of Artsakh as a republic and the disbanding of Artsakh’s government and defense forces.

**Question:**
* Many experts say that officials do not have the right to take down decisions that were made by the people, by elections and referendums. So is Shahramanyan’s dissolution technically valid, or is it just that the Azeris have the power right now, and it’s either what they say, or you die?

Since December 2022, Artsakhtsis endured 9 months of a blockade, followed by an intense 2-day war, only to quickly bury their dead and evacuate their homeland. Families had to leave knowing that their loved ones are still missing or unaccounted for from the latest fighting. Samvel Shahramanyan and a small team have [stayed behind](https://www.facebook.com/ArtsakhInformation/posts/pfbid02H9GXKjXQ3cAmqZ5rXVz7KsTrUzVEK3kXTE3aVCtocZT1jSSZGprnzFgzCPxuJJXMl), to continue the search for missing bodies.

Hindsight is 20-20, but many Artsakhtsis are questioning the decision to resist the blockade for 9 months, then to lose so many lives, only to completely capitulate and be expelled from their homes. 

We know there were reports that the West was urging Stepanakert to negotiate on so-called “reintegration” back in July., and clearly the authorities in Artsakh couldn’t expect help from Yerevan.

**Questions**:
* How did the Artsakh authorities intend to hold back the Azeris? What made them decide to reject Baku’s initial demands, as painful and humiliating as they were? Should Artsakh’s leadership have accepted to go to Yevlakh in July? 


## What “Peace Treaty” in Granada?

As Artsakhtsis are looking for shelter in refugee camps, and the blood has still not dried on the ground in Artsakh, Armenian officials such as Alen Simonyan are apparently very [optimistic](https://news.am/eng/news/783039.html) that a so-called “peace treaty” is close. There are rumors that it could be signed as early as October 5, when Aliyev and Pashinyan meet in Grenada.

**Questions**:
* What would be the parameters of such a peace treaty?
    * Corridors?
    * Return of Azeris to Armenia?
* Is it in Armenia’s interests to rush to sign this treaty? If not, does Armenia have a way to not sign it?


## Arrested Artsakh Leaders Held Hostage

The exodus from Artsakh was accompanied by detention of key Armenian leaders.

* Ruben Vardanyan was arrested as he was trying to cross the Hakari bridge checkpoint.
* Major General Davit Manukyan, First Deputy Commander of the Artsakh Defense Army (and brother of Armenian MP Gegham Manukyan) was also arrested.
* Lt. General Levon Mnatsakanyan, former Commander of the Artsakh Defense Army was also arrested.
* Davit Babayan, former foreign minister of Artsakh and later advisor to president Arayik Harutyunyan, turned himself in, arguing that not doing so would cause damage to people around him.

There are reports that Azerbaijan has compiled a list of hundreds of statesmen and military leaders, seeking their arrest. So it’s quite possible that the number of detainees may increase.

Add to this all the existing POWs and civilians held by Baku since 2020.

**Question**:
* Arthur, what can be done to get our men back? Is there a difference between Ruben Vardanyan for instance vs. a general vs. a regular rank and file soldier?
