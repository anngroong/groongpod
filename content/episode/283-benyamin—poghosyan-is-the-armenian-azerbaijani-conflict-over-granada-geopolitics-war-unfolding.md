## Outstanding Causes of the Armenian Azerbaijani Conflict

The 2020 defeat in the second war in Artsakh culminated last week in the complete surrendering of Artsakh to Azerbaijan, by Pashinyan’s government. But is the conflict over? In this **Conversations on Groong** episode, we’ll take a look at the aftermath of the [great exodus of Armenians from their indigenous lands in Artsakh](https://abcnews.go.com/International/nagorno-karabakh-enclave-emptied-entire-armenian-population-flees/story?id=103655356), and what Armenia is facing geopolitically at this juncture.

Even though we’ve been seeing the demise of the Artsakh Republic coming, ever since the defeat in the 44-day war in 2020, I guess most Armenians both in the republic, as well as the diaspora, had held out hope that it would not come to pass. You and many experts we talk to weekly on our show have been warning of this disastrous outcome for three years now.

**Question:**
* Is the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over?


## Why Did Aliyev Bail Out of Granada?

Just yesterday, [Aliyev declined](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1121173.html) the long-scheduled summit with Pashinyan in Granada, Spain. He reportedly requested that Turkish president Erdogan be present at the summit, as well as the French, German, and EU leaders. They refused, and so Aliyev bailed out. Clearly he’s unhappy, and he didn’t like the picture in Granada, and this doesn’t portend well for the so-called “peace treaty” that Pashinyan and his circle keep pushing and idolizing.

**Questions:**
* What does this mean for the state of the negotiations?

[Reportedly](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-us-and-russia-held-secret-talks-days-before-nagorno-karabakh-crisis/) the US, Russia and the EU met “secretly” in Istanbul to discuss “the standoff on Nagorno Karabakh”.

**Questions:**
* Why did these current enemies meet on this topic?
* Who initiated the meeting?


## How Might Events Unfold?

Each of the major geopolitical players have their interests in the region.

**Questions:**
* What are those interests?
* Could Azerbaijan attack Armenia?
* How Might Events Unfold?
