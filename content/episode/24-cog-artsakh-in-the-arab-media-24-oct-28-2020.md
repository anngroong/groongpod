Description = """Conversations on Groong:
Artsakh in the Arab Media - Oct 28, 2020

Since September 27, Azerbaijan has been waging an all out war on Artsakh, cluster-bombing towns and villages and killing civilians and destroying churches and cultural centers, with the aim to destroy and depopulate the region. The worldwide Armenian Diaspora has come together to fight this existential threat.

We’ve read much about the Diaspora’s activities around most of the world, but what about the Arab world? This episode explores some of the challenges and opportunities that the Armenian communities in the Arab world face.

To help guide today’s Conversation on Groong, we have with us Prof. 𝐀𝐬𝐛𝐞𝐝 𝐊𝐨𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐤𝐢𝐚𝐧, who is a senior lecturer of political science and international relations at Bentley University in Massachusetts where he teaches courses on the Middle East and the former Soviet space.

Prof. Kotchikian is joined by:

𝐊𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐚 𝐏𝐞𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐤𝐢𝐚𝐧, who has been teaching at the American University of Beirut since 1988. She has published two books which compile newspaper articles and reports from the Genocide years published in the Canadian and British press. Katia has been compiling news for the Armenian News Network Groong since 1999.

And

𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐚 𝐘𝐚𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐛𝐢𝐚𝐧, who is the executive director of the Armenian National committee of the Middle East. She’s a PhD candidate in political science and a lecturer at the American university of Beirut (AUB) in politics. Vera also teaches courses on The Armenian Genocide at Haigazian university.
