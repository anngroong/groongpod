The news yesterday was that another[ meeting](https://www.azatutyun.am/a/32294757.html) took place between Artsakh and Azerbaijani representatives.

* What is your view of the meetings between the two sides, who are reportedly discussing humanitarian and operational issues?

Today, president Arayik Harutyunyan[ introduced](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1105313.html) the new state minister, Gurgen Nersesyan, who is replacing Ruben Vardanyan. He has the helm of all Artsakh ministries except foreign affairs and defense. Those roll up directly to president Harutyunyan.

* What’s your impression of Nerseyan, what do we know about him?

We’ve read that the chair of the Artsakh national security council, Samvel Shahramanyan, is[ leading the negotiations](https://168.am/2023/03/01/1840077.html) with the Azeris, who have appointed MP Ramin Mammadov as their rep. Together with Shahramanyan is[ Sergey Martirosyan](https://hraparak.am/post/36fecc2b0aaad4d8fdcede11e0cb865d), who has ties to Russian General Rustam Muratov.

* Who are they?

The Azeri side has[ presented](https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/3716953.html) these meetings as being about “reintegrating Karabakh Armenians back into Azerbaijan”. There have been multiple official[ rejections](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1105355.html) of this view from Artsakh, and[ statements](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1105361.html) that Artsakh is not discussing its status with Azerbaijan, and the current talks are not a replacement for peace negotiations.

* What’s the view from inside?
