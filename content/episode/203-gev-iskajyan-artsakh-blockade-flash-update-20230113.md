## Discussion

* [Internet connectivity](https://armenpress.am/eng/news/1101642.html) was restored in Artsakh later this afternoon.
* Today is the 33rd day of the #ArtsakhBlockade - but it also marks the 33rd anniversary of the Baku and Sumgait pogroms against Armenians in Azerbaijan. Does anything ever change, when it comes to hate against the Armenians in Azerbaijan?
